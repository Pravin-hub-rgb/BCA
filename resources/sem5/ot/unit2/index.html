            <h2>Linear Programming Problem (LPP)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What is LPP?</strong>
                    Linear Programming Problem (LPP) is a mathematical technique used to achieve the best possible
                    outcome in a given situation, often involving maximization of profits or minimization of costs.
                    Think about running a business—what is the main goal? The primary objective is usually profit
                    maximization or cost minimization.
                    <br>
                    For example, a company might want to maximize its profit or minimize its costs given a set of
                    limitations or resources. In LPP, the objective function is the formula that represents this goal.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Objective Function:</strong>
                    In LPP, we typically encounter two types of problems:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maximization: An objective function might look like <strong>Z = x + 2y</strong>, where the
                            goal is to maximize Z (profit, output, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Minimization: Another example could be <strong>Z = 2x + 3y</strong>, where the objective is
                            to minimize Z (cost, time, etc.).</li>
                    </ul>
                    The variables <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> are decision variables that represent
                    quantities (like products, resources, etc.) in the real-world problem.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Constraints:</strong>
                    Every business operates under certain limitations, such as limited resources like manpower, money,
                    time, land, or raw materials. These limitations are known as **constraints** in LPP.
                    <br>
                    Constraints are represented as inequalities because they indicate the limits within which the
                    decision variables must operate. For example:
                    <br><strong>2x + 3y ≥ 5</strong> (resource must be more than or equal to 5)<br>
                    <strong>x + y ≤ 7</strong> (resource must be less than or equal to 7)
                </li>

                <li><strong>Non-negativity Restriction:</strong>
                    In most real-world scenarios, the decision variables (like products, resources, etc.) cannot be
                    negative. Therefore, in LPP, we assume:
                    <br><strong>x ≥ 0</strong>, <strong>y ≥ 0</strong>
                    <br>
                    This condition ensures that the solution is realistic and practical.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Summary of LPP Components:</strong>
                    In summary, a Linear Programming Problem consists of two main components:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Objective Function</strong>: This is the function you aim to maximize or minimize
                            (profit, cost, time, etc.).</li>
                        <li><strong>Constraints</strong>: These are the limitations or restrictions on the resources
                            available, usually in the form of inequalities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Together, these components form the LPP model, which helps in decision-making for optimal outcomes.
                </li>
            </ul>

                        <br><strong>Subject to the constraints:</strong>

                            <br>We start by finding the points where the constraints intersect the axes, as these points
                            will help us plot the lines representing the constraints.

                                    giving the point

                        <li><strong>Step 2: Draw the lines and identify the feasible region</strong>
                            <br>We now plot the lines <strong>x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 4</strong> and
                            <strong>3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 6</strong> on a graph using the points found
                            earlier.
                            <br>
                            The feasible region is the area where both constraints overlap, and it represents the
                            possible
                            values of <strong>x<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>x<sub>2</sub> </strong> that satisfy
                            all
                            constraints.
                            <br>
                            Since both constraints have ≤, the feasible region will be the area below both lines,
                            towards
                            the origin (0, 0).

                        <li><strong>Step 3: Identify the corner points of the feasible region</strong>
                            <br>The optimal solution of an LPP in the graphical method will always lie at one of the
                            corner
                            points (vertices) of the feasible region.
                            <br>The corner points in this example are:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>O</strong>: (0, 0) – the origin</li>
                                <li><strong>A</strong>: (2, 0) – where <strong>3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> =

                                <li><strong>B</strong>: The intersection of the two constraints
                                    <strong>x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 4</strong> and
                                    <strong>3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 6</strong>. To find B, we solve both
                                    equations
                                    simultaneously:
                                    <br>Solve the system:
                                    <br><strong>x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 4</strong>
                                    <br><strong>3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 6</strong>
                                    <br>Subtract the first equation from the second:
                                    <br><strong>(3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub>) - (x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub>) = 6

                                    <br>This simplifies to:
                                    <br><strong>2x<sub>1</sub> = 2</strong>, so <strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 1</strong>.
                                    <br>Substitute <strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 1</strong> into
                                    <strong>x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 4</strong>:

                                        3/2</strong>.
                                    <br>The intersection point <strong>B</strong> is (1, 3/2).

                        <li><strong>Step 4: Evaluate the objective function at each corner point</strong>
                            <br>Now, we substitute the coordinates of each corner point into the objective function
                            <strong>Z = 3x<sub>1</sub> + 4x<sub>2</sub></strong> to find the value of Z at each point:
                            <ul>
                                <li>At <strong>O</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(0) + 4(0) = 0</strong></li>
                                <li>At <strong>A</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(2) + 4(0) = 6</strong></li>
                                <li>At <strong>B</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(1) + 4(3/2) = 3 + 6 = 9</strong></li>
                                <li>At <strong>C</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(0) + 4(2) = 8</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Step 5: Determine the optimal solution</strong>
                            <br>Since the problem is a maximization problem, the optimal solution will be the point that
                            gives the maximum value of Z.
                            <br>From the calculations, we see that the maximum value of Z is 9, which occurs at point
                            <strong>B (1, 3/2)</strong>.
                            <br>Thus, the optimal solution is:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 1</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>x<sub>2</sub> = 3/2</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Step 6: Minimization (if required)</strong>
                            <br>If we were tasked with minimizing Z instead of maximizing it, the minimum value would
                            occur
                            at the origin <strong>O (0, 0)</strong>, where <strong>Z = 0</strong>.

                            <br>Just like in the maximization case, the optimal solution for a minimization problem also

                                <li><strong>R</strong>: The intersection of the two constraints. To find this point, we

                            <br>Since the problem is a minimization problem, the optimal solution will be the point that
                            gives the minimum value of Z.
                            <br>From the calculations, we see that the minimum value of Z is 9, which occurs at point

                            <br>Thus, the optimal solution is:

                        <li><strong>Note: Unbounded Solution (if the question was for maximization)</strong>
                            <br>If this problem were a maximization problem, the solution would be unbounded.
                            <br>This is because, as we move away from the origin in the feasible region, the value of Z
                            increases indefinitely.
                            <br>Thus, there is no maximum value for Z, and we say the solution is unbounded.

                            <br>However, due to the nature of the constraints, every point on the line segment
                            connecting A and B also yields a value of <strong>Z = 6</strong>. Therefore, there are
                            infinitely many solutions within that segment, leading to an <strong>infinite

                        <li><strong>Step 5: Determine the optimal solution</strong>
                            <br>In this case, we have two points (A and B) that give the same maximum value of Z:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>A (2, 0):</strong> Z = 6</li>

                            </ul>
                            This indicates that there are multiple optimal solutions. Therefore, the solution is
                            classified as an <strong>alternative optimal solution</strong> since the maximum Z can be
                            achieved at both points.

                        <li><strong>Step 6: Discuss the type of solution</strong>
                            <br>Since both points A and B yield the same maximum value for Z (which is 6), we can
                            conclude that:

                                <li>This problem has <strong>alternative solutions</strong>, as there are multiple
                                    combinations of <strong>x<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>x<sub>2</sub></strong>
                                    that

                                <li>Moreover, if we extend the feasible region further, we may find that there are
                                    infinite solutions along the line segment connecting points A and B. Hence, the
                                    solution can also be described as having <strong>infinite optimal

                            <br> constraints:

                        <li>Now we have the concept of basic variable BV are those variable which make unit matrix like x3 and x4 in our constraints as in first contraint x3 and x4 are 1, 0 and in second constraint x3 and x4 are 0, 1 making a unit matrix 
                            <br> ustally these basic varaible are the slick variable that we add to our constraints

                        <li>To solve an LPP using the Simplex Method, we must ensure that the objective function is in
                            maximization form. If it is a minimization problem, we first convert it to a maximization
                            problem.</li>

                        <li>Next, we need to balance the constraints. For constraints with ≤ signs, we add slack
                            variables to convert inequalities into equalities. For example, if we have a ≤ constraint,
                            we add a slack variable. Similarly, if we have a ≥ constraint, we subtract a surplus
                            variable to achieve equality.</li>

                        <li>The variables x3 and x4 are known as the basic variables, as they form the identity matrix

        </pre>
                            Here, Zj - Cj row shows the difference between the calculated and actual costs. The most
                            negative value, -5 (in the x1 column), indicates that x1 should enter the basis.

                            To decide which variable to remove from the basis (x3 or x4), we compute the minimum ratio
                            of b values and the coefficients in the x1 column:

  0  | x3  |  15 |  3   |  5   |  1   |  0   | 15/3 = 5

            </code>
        </pre>
                            As 2 is the smallest ratio, x4 is the outgoing variable, and x1 will replace x4 in the
                            basis.
                        </li>

                        <li>Now, we pivot on the key element (5 in the x1 column, row 2). After performing row
                            operations, the updated tableau looks like this:

                            Here, (-13M-8)/7 is the most negative, which makes x1 the entering variable.
                            <br>Now, find the ratio of b and x1 to identify the outgoing variable.
                            <br>Row 1 ratio of b/x1 = 21/13
                            <br>Row 2 ratio of b/x1 = 7
                            <br>Thus, 21/13 is the smallest ratio, making x5 the outgoing variable, and 13/7 is the key
                            value.
                        </li>
                        <li>For row 1, we will multiply row 1 by 7/13.
                            <br>For row 2, we will perform the following operation: row 2 = row 2 - 1/7 * row 1 (new).

                            Now, as all Zj - Cj values are ≥ 0, we have found our optimal solution.
                            <br>x1 = 21/13
                            <br>x2 = 10/13
                            <br>Min Z = (21/13) + (10/13) = 31/13
