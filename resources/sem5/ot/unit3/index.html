        <h1>Game Theory</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game:</strong> A game is any activity where two or more people follow a set of rules while
                competing with each other. The players can either gain something or lose something by the end of the
                game. The rules and procedures are what shape the game, turning it into a situation where different
                parties are in competition or conflict.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Game Theory:</strong> Game theory, on the other hand, is all about understanding how people make
                decisions when they’re interacting with others. The result for each person (or player) depends on what
                everyone else does. So, when someone is deciding what to do or what strategy to follow, they have to
                think about what the other players might choose to do as well.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Uses of Game Theory:</strong> Game theory helps organizations make strategic choices internally
                or externally, especially against competitors.
                <br>It models various situations through hypothetical games, predicting player behavior in competitive
                environments.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Types of Games</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Two-Person and N-Person Games:</strong>
                    In two-person games, there are only two players, though each may have many possible choices.
                    If more than two people are involved, it is called an n-person game.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Zero-Sum Game:</strong>
                    A zero-sum game is one where the total gains and losses of all players equal zero, regardless of the
                    outcome.
                    The points gained by winners are offset by the points lost by losers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Two-Person Zero-Sum Game:</strong>
                    This type involves two players where the gain of one equals the loss of the other.
                    It is often represented by a rectangular pay-off matrix.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <p>The term <strong>Strategy</strong> refers to a complete plan of action, specifying what a player will do
                in any
                future contingency during the game. Strategies can be classified as:
                <br>(i) Pure strategy (ii) Mixed strategy
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pure Strategy:</strong>
                    A strategy is called pure if one knows in advance of the play that it is certain to be adopted,
                    irrespective of the strategy the other players might choose.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mixed Strategy:</strong>
                    The optimal strategy mixture for each player is determined by assigning probabilities to each
                    strategy.
                    This is called a mixed strategy because it is a probabilistic combination of available choices.
                    Mixed strategies are denoted by a set:
                    <br>S = {x1, x2, ..., xn}, where x is the probability of choosing a course of action.
                    <br>So, x1 + x2 + ... + xn = 1.
                    <br>Note: A pure strategy is a special case of a mixed strategy.

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Pay-Off</h2>
            <p>Pay-off is the outcome of playing the game. A pay-off matrix is a table showing the amount received by
                the player after all possible plays of the game. The payment is made by the player listed at the top of
                the table.
                <br>If Player A has <em>m</em> courses of action and Player B has <em>n</em> courses, the pay-off matrix
                is constructed as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Row designations represent Player A's courses of action.</li>
                <li>Column designations represent Player B's courses of action.</li>
                <li>In a two-person zero-sum game, the entries in Player B's pay-off matrix will be the negatives of the
                    corresponding entries in Player A's pay-off matrix. For example:
                    <p class="mc">
                        Player A's Pay-Off Matrix:

                        1 & a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>The Maximin - Minimax Principle</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This principle is used for the selection of optimal strategies by two players. Consider two players,
                    A and B.
                    Player A wishes to maximize their gains, while Player B wishes to minimize their losses. Since A
                    would like to
                    maximize their minimum gain, the value obtained for Player A is called the maximin value, and the
                    corresponding
                    strategy is called the maximin strategy.
                    <br>
                    On the other hand, since Player B wishes to minimize their maximum losses, a value called the
                    minimax value,
                    which is the minimum of the maximum losses, is calculated. The corresponding strategy is called the
                    minimax
                    strategy. When these two values are equal (maximin value = minimax value), the corresponding
                    strategies are
                    called optimal strategies, and the game is said to have a saddle point. The value of the game is
                    given by the
                    saddle point.
                    <br>
                    The selection of maximin and minimax strategies by A and B is based on the so-called maximin-minimax
                    principle,
                    which guarantees the best of the worst results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Saddle Point:</strong> A saddle point is a position in the payoff matrix where the maximum
                    of row minima
                    coincides with the minimum of column maxima. The payoff at the saddle point is called the value of
                    the game.
                    <br>
                    For example, in a 2x2 payoff matrix:
                    <p class="mc">
                        \[
                        \begin{pmatrix}
                        3 & 5 \\
                        6 & 4 \\
                        \end{pmatrix}
                        \]
                    </p>
                    - Find the minimum value in each row: Row 1 = 3, Row 2 = 4. <br>
                    - Find the maximum value in each column: Column 1 = 6, Column 2 = 5.<br>
                    - The saddle point exists where the maximum of the row minima (4) equals the minimum of the column
                    maxima (4).<br>
                    - Here, the saddle point is at position (2,2) with a value of 4.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The values used in the maximin and minimax principles are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The maximin value is the value that Player A aims to maximize in the worst-case scenario of
                            their strategies.</li>
                        <li>The minimax value is the value that Player B aims to minimize in the worst-case scenario of
                            the strategies
                            chosen by Player A.</li>
                        <li>The value of the game is the outcome at the saddle point, which represents the optimal

                        <li>The game is said to be fair if the maximin value equals the minimax value and both are 0,

                        <li>If the maximin value does not equal the minimax value, the game is indeterminate and players

                <p>Let’s solve this step by step:</p>
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, we look at the <em>row minima</em>. These values tell us the worst
                    outcome for Player A if they pick each row. Player A wants to make sure they get the best possible
                    payoff, even in the worst case. So, they will choose the row with the highest row minimum.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Row Minima:

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, we look at the <em>column maxima</em>. These values tell us the best
                    outcome for Player B if they pick each column. Player B wants to limit Player A's gain as much as
                    possible, so they will choose the column with the lowest column maximum.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Optimal Strategy: (A2, B3)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>In simple terms:</strong></p>
                <p>Player A wants to play it safe and go for the highest guaranteed payoff. To do this, they look at the
                    smallest numbers in each row (called the row minima) and pick the best of those. On the other hand,
                    Player B wants to keep Player A’s payoff as low as possible. So, they focus on the largest numbers
                    in each column (called the column maxima) to try to limit Player A’s gain. <br>

                    If the number Player A picks (from the row minima) matches the number Player B picks (from the
                    column maxima), it’s called a saddle point. At this point, the game is solved!</p>

            <h2>Games Without Saddle Points (Mixed Strategy)</h2>
            <p>In some two-person zero-sum games, a saddle point does not exist. This happens when the <strong>max of
                    the row minima</strong> is not equal to the <strong>min of the column maxima</strong>. Such games
                are solved using <em>mixed strategies</em>, where players assign probabilities to their strategies
                instead of selecting a single pure strategy.</p>
            <p>Various methods are available to solve games without a saddle point, depending on the size and structure
                of the payoff matrix:</p>

                            <p>For 2x2 games, the mixed strategy solution involves solving simultaneous linear equations
                                to find the optimal probabilities for each player. The expected value of the game is
                                then calculated using these probabilities.</p>

                                than two. The strategy probabilities are determined by plotting payoff lines on a graph

                            <p>For larger games (e.g., 5x6), the dominance property helps simplify the matrix by
                                eliminating dominated rows or columns. A row or column is dominated if there exists
                                another row or column that gives equal or better payoffs in all scenarios. After
                                reduction, simpler solution methods like the graphical or algebraic method can be
                                applied.</p>

                <li>A mixed strategy is when a player doesn’t stick to just one choice (pure strategy) but instead
                    assigns probabilities to multiple choices. It’s like saying, “I’ll pick option A 60% of the time and
                    option B 40% of the time.” This way, the player keeps their opponent guessing and ensures a better
                    outcome in games where no single choice (pure strategy) is the best.</li>

                <h3>Dominance Property</h3>
                <p>The principle of dominance is a simple way to simplify a game matrix. It says that if one strategy is
                    clearly better than another in all situations, we can ignore the weaker strategy. This helps reduce
                    the size of the payoff matrix without affecting the optimal solution.</p>
                <p>Let’s break it down:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A strategy <strong>dominates</strong> another strategy if it is better (or at least not worse)
                        in every possible condition.
                        <ul>
                            <li>For example, if you’re comparing two rows (strategies for Player A) and one row always
                                has better payoffs than the other, you can ignore the weaker row.</li>
                            <li>Similarly, for columns (strategies for Player B), if one column always gives worse
                                payoffs than another, you can ignore it.</li>
                        </ul>

                            game easier without changing the final result.</p>

                <p><strong>The Rules of Dominance:</strong></p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Row Dominance:</strong>
                        <p>Compare two rows. If one row (e.g., Row k) has values that are greater than or equal to the
                            corresponding values in another row (e.g., Row r), then Row k is dominated by Row r. The
                            dominated row (k) can be removed since it will never lead to a better outcome.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Remove the row with the minimum values because it offers less
                            favorable outcomes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Column Dominance:</strong>
                        <p>Compare two columns. If one column (e.g., Column k) has values that are less than or equal to
                            the corresponding values in another column (e.g., Column r), then Column k is dominated by
                            Column r. The dominated column (k) can be removed as it always gives worse payoffs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Remove the column with the maximum values because it
                            represents less favorable strategies.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reducing the Payoff Matrix:</strong>
                        <p>We can delete dominated rows and columns to make the matrix smaller. This makes calculations
                            easier without affecting the optimal strategies.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Combination Dominance:</strong>
                        <p>Sometimes, a linear combination of rows or columns can dominate another row or column. In
                            that case, the dominated row or column can still be removed. This is less common but follows
                            the same idea.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>In simple terms:</strong></p>
                <p>The dominance property helps us focus only on the important strategies by removing weaker ones. It’s
                    like cleaning up unnecessary options in a game to make solving it faster and simpler!</p>

</pre>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Step 1: Check for a Saddle Point:</strong></p>
                            <p>A saddle point exists if the max of the row minima equals the min of the column maxima.
                                Let’s calculate these:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Row Minima:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Row 1: Min(1, 7, 2) = 1</li>
                                        <li>Row 2: Min(6, 2, 7) = 2</li>
                                        <li>Row 3: Min(5, 1, 6) = 1</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Max(Row Minima) = 2
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Column Maxima:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Column 1: Max(1, 6, 5) = 6</li>
                                        <li>Column 2: Max(7, 2, 1) = 7</li>
                                        <li>Column 3: Max(2, 7, 6) = 7</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Min(Column Maxima) = 6
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Since Max(Row Minima) ≠ Min(Column Maxima), there is no saddle point. We proceed using
                                the <strong>dominance property</strong> to simplify the matrix.</p>

                            <p><strong>Step 2: Apply Dominance Property:</strong></p>
                            <p>We simplify the matrix by identifying dominated rows or columns and removing them:</p>
                            <ol>

                                    <p>Let’s compare the columns pairwise:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Column 1 vs Column 3:</strong>
                                            <p>Column 1: (1, 6, 5) | Column 3: (2, 7, 6)</p>
                                            <p>All values in Column 3 are greater than or equal to the corresponding
                                                values in Column 1. This means <strong>Column 3 is dominating Column
                                                    1</strong>. We remove Column 3.</p>

                                <li><strong>Compare Row 1 and Row 3:</strong>
                                    <p>Row 1: (1, 7) | Row 3: (5, 1)</p>
                                    <p>All values in Row 1 are less than or equal to the corresponding values in Row 3.
                                        This means <strong>Row 3 is dominated by Row 1</strong>, and we can remove Row

                            <p><strong>Step 4: Solving the 2x2 Game Matrix:</strong></p>
                            <p>Now that we have a 2x2 matrix, we can apply the dominance property again or use a
                                different method to find the optimal strategies. In this case, we will:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Row Player’s Optimal Strategy:</strong> Player A will choose Row 1 because
                                    it gives the highest payoff in both columns.</li>
                                <li><strong>Column Player’s Optimal Strategy:</strong> Player B will choose Column 2, as
                                    it gives the highest payoff for Player B when Player A chooses Row 1.</li>

                            <p>Thus, the optimal solution occurs at the cell (Row 1, Column 2), which has a payoff of
                                <strong>7</strong> for Player A and <strong>7</strong> for Player B.</p>
