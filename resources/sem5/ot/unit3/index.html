        <h1>Game Theory</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game:</strong> Game is defined as an activity involving two or more persons following a set of
                rules.
                At the end of the game, participants may gain benefits or incur losses.
                The rules and procedures define the game, which represents a competitive situation or conflict between
                two or more parties.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Game Theory:</strong> Game theory studies interactive decision-making, where the outcome for
                each participant
                (or player) depends on the actions of all others. When deciding on a course of action or strategy,
                players must consider the choices of others.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Uses of Game Theory:</strong> Game theory helps organizations make strategic choices internally
                or externally, especially against competitors.
                <br>It models various situations through hypothetical games, predicting player behavior in competitive
                environments.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Types of Games</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Two-Person and N-Person Games:</strong>
                    In two-person games, there are only two players, though each may have many possible choices.
                    If more than two people are involved, it is called an n-person game.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Zero-Sum Game:</strong>
                    A zero-sum game is one where the total gains and losses of all players equal zero, regardless of the
                    outcome.
                    The points gained by winners are offset by the points lost by losers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Two-Person Zero-Sum Game:</strong>
                    This type involves two players where the gain of one equals the loss of the other.
                    It is often represented by a rectangular pay-off matrix.
                </li>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <p>The term <strong>Strategy</strong> refers to a complete plan of action, specifying what a player will do
                in any
                future contingency during the game. Strategies can be classified as:
                <br>(i) Pure strategy (ii) Mixed strategy
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pure Strategy:</strong>
                    A strategy is called pure if one knows in advance of the play that it is certain to be adopted,
                    irrespective of the strategy the other players might choose.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mixed Strategy:</strong>
                    The optimal strategy mixture for each player is determined by assigning probabilities to each
                    strategy.
                    This is called a mixed strategy because it is a probabilistic combination of available choices.
                    Mixed strategies are denoted by a set:
                    <br>S = {x1, x2, ..., xn}, where x is the probability of choosing a course of action.
                    <br>So, x1 + x2 + ... + xn = 1.
                    <br>Note: A pure strategy is a special case of a mixed strategy.

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Pay-Off</h2>
            <p>Pay-off is the outcome of playing the game. A pay-off matrix is a table showing the amount received by
                the player after all possible plays of the game. The payment is made by the player listed at the top of
                the table.
                <br>If Player A has <em>m</em> courses of action and Player B has <em>n</em> courses, the pay-off matrix
                is constructed as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Row designations represent Player A's courses of action.</li>
                <li>Column designations represent Player B's courses of action.</li>
                <li>In a two-person zero-sum game, the entries in Player B's pay-off matrix will be the negatives of the
                    corresponding entries in Player A's pay-off matrix. For example:
                    <p class="mc">
                        Player A's Pay-Off Matrix:

            <h2>The Maximin - Minimax Principle</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This principle is used for the selection of optimal strategies by two players. Consider two players,
                    A and B.
                    Player A wishes to maximize their gains, while Player B wishes to minimize their losses. Since A
                    would like to
                    maximize their minimum gain, the value obtained for Player A is called the maximin value, and the
                    corresponding
                    strategy is called the maximin strategy.
                    <br>
                    On the other hand, since Player B wishes to minimize their maximum losses, a value called the
                    minimax value,
                    which is the minimum of the maximum losses, is calculated. The corresponding strategy is called the
                    minimax
                    strategy. When these two values are equal (maximin value = minimax value), the corresponding
                    strategies are
                    called optimal strategies, and the game is said to have a saddle point. The value of the game is
                    given by the
                    saddle point.
                    <br>
                    The selection of maximin and minimax strategies by A and B is based on the so-called maximin-minimax
                    principle,
                    which guarantees the best of the worst results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Saddle Point:</strong> A saddle point is a position in the payoff matrix where the maximum
                    of row minima
                    coincides with the minimum of column maxima. The payoff at the saddle point is called the value of
                    the game.
                    <br>
                    For example, in a 2x2 payoff matrix:
                    <p class="mc">
                        \[
                        \begin{pmatrix}
                        3 & 5 \\
                        6 & 4 \\
                        \end{pmatrix}
                        \]
                    </p>
                    - Find the minimum value in each row: Row 1 = 3, Row 2 = 4. <br>
                    - Find the maximum value in each column: Column 1 = 6, Column 2 = 5.<br>
                    - The saddle point exists where the maximum of the row minima (4) equals the minimum of the column
                    maxima (4).<br>
                    - Here, the saddle point is at position (2,2) with a value of 4.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The values used in the maximin and minimax principles are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The maximin value is the value that Player A aims to maximize in the worst-case scenario of
                            their strategies.</li>
                        <li>The minimax value is the value that Player B aims to minimize in the worst-case scenario of
                            the strategies
                            chosen by Player A.</li>
                        <li>The value of the game is the outcome at the saddle point, which represents the optimal

                <p>Let’s solve this step by step:</p>
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, we look at the <em>row minima</em>. These values tell us the worst
                    outcome for Player A if they pick each row. Player A wants to make sure they get the best possible
                    payoff, even in the worst case. So, they will choose the row with the highest row minimum.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Row Minima:

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, we look at the <em>column maxima</em>. These values tell us the best
                    outcome for Player B if they pick each column. Player B wants to limit Player A's gain as much as
                    possible, so they will choose the column with the lowest column maximum.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Optimal Strategy: (A2, B3)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>In simple terms:</strong></p>
                <p>Player A wants the highest guaranteed payoff (the best of the worst cases), so they focus on the row
                    minima. Player B wants to limit Player A's gain as much as possible, so they focus on the column
                    maxima.
                    When these two match, a saddle point exists, and the game is solved!</p>
