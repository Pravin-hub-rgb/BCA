            <h2>Network Analysis: CPM and PERT</h2>
            <p>Network analysis is a method used in project management to plan, schedule, and control complex projects.
                Two of the most popular techniques under network analysis are the Critical Path Method (CPM) and the
                Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT). These techniques help project managers in managing
                their projects effectively by providing tools to visualize tasks, time estimates, and resources.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Key Terms in Network Analysis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Activity:</strong> An activity is any task or work that needs to be done in a project.
                        It's a part of the project that consumes time and resources (such as manpower, materials, money,
                        etc.). It is represented by an arrow in network diagrams.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event (or Node):</strong> An event is a milestone or a point in time that marks the
                        beginning or end of an activity. Events do not consume time or resources and are represented as
                        circles or nodes in a network diagram.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network:</strong> A network is a graphical representation that shows the sequence and
                        logical relationship between activities and events in a project. It is also known as an arrow
                        diagram, where arrows represent activities, and circles represent events.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>What is a Project?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Project:</strong> A project is a collection of interrelated tasks that need to be
                        executed in a specific order to achieve a goal. Projects usually have a clear objective, and the
                        activities must be planned in sequence to avoid delays or inefficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basic Requirements of a Project:</strong> A project must be completed on time, with
                        minimal use of resources and investment. Managing these requirements is key to project success.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Phases of Project Management</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Project Planning:</strong> This is the first phase where the project is broken down into
                        individual tasks or activities. You will also determine time estimates for each task and
                        establish the precedence relationships between tasks (which tasks need to be completed before
                        others).</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Scheduling:</strong> In this phase, you calculate the exact start and finish
                        times for each activity. You also determine the earliest and latest times at which the project’s
                        events can occur.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Controlling:</strong> This phase involves reviewing the progress of the project
                        by comparing the actual work accomplished with the scheduled work. If there are any deviations,
                        the schedule is updated accordingly to keep the project on track.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Understanding CPM (Critical Path Method)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CPM:</strong> The Critical Path Method is an activity-oriented technique, meaning it
                        focuses on activities and their relationships. It is a deterministic model, meaning it provides
                        a fixed time estimate for the completion of each activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fixed Time:</strong> In CPM, each activity has a fixed time duration. The method works
                        best when the duration of activities is well-known and does not vary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetitive Projects:</strong> CPM is commonly used for projects with repetitive tasks,
                        such as the construction of buildings or bridges. The time for each activity can be predicted
                        with certainty.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Understanding PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pert:</strong> The Program Evaluation and Review Technique is an event-oriented network
                        method. It focuses on the events (milestones) that occur between activities. PERT is a
                        probabilistic model, which means it accounts for uncertainty in activity durations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Range of Time:</strong> Unlike CPM (Critical Path Method), PERT takes a different approach by using a range of time estimates for each task. Instead of relying on a single fixed duration, PERT looks at three scenarios: the optimistic time (if everything goes perfectly), the pessimistic time (if things take longer than expected), and the most likely time (the duration you think is most realistic). By considering these different possibilities, PERT helps you estimate the chances of finishing the project within a specific time frame, giving a more flexible and realistic view of the schedule.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-repetitive Projects:</strong> PERT is used for non-repetitive or one-time projects
                        where the duration of tasks is uncertain. Examples include launching a satellite or conducting
                        research projects.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>CPM vs PERT: Key Differences</h3>
                <img src="../../images/ot12.jpeg" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Application of CMP & PERT:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Project Scheduling:</strong> CPM and PERT are widely used for scheduling complex projects by
                    dividing them into smaller, manageable activities. These techniques enable project managers to
                    visualize the sequence of tasks, determine the starting and ending times for each, and ensure that
                    the project stays on track. For instance, in construction projects or event planning, they help
                    identify dependencies and allocate resources efficiently to minimize delays. By offering a
                    structured timeline, CPM and PERT make it easier to monitor progress and adjust schedules if
                    unexpected issues arise.</li>
                <li><strong>Identifying the Critical Path:</strong> One of the key advantages of CPM and PERT is their
                    ability to identify the critical path. This path represents the sequence of tasks that directly
                    impacts the project's completion time. By focusing on these critical activities, project managers
                    can prioritize resources and ensure that any delays on the critical path are addressed promptly.
                    This feature is especially useful in projects where time is a significant constraint, such as
                    launching a product or completing a public infrastructure project.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> These techniques help in optimizing the allocation of
                    resources like manpower, machinery, and materials. CPM is particularly effective in balancing
                    resource usage by identifying periods of high demand and adjusting schedules to avoid overuse or
                    underutilization. For example, in manufacturing, CPM ensures that machines and workforce are used
                    effectively without unnecessary downtime or bottlenecks.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> PERT excels in scenarios involving uncertainty by incorporating
                    three time estimates—optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely. This allows project managers to
                    assess risks and prepare contingency plans. In research and development projects, where timelines
                    are often uncertain, PERT provides a realistic understanding of potential delays and helps in
                    mitigating their impact on the overall schedule.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Control:</strong> Both CPM and PERT facilitate cost management by highlighting areas
                    where savings can be achieved. CPM, in particular, helps identify opportunities for "crashing"
                    activities, where additional resources can be allocated to shorten the timeline without exceeding
                    the budget. This is especially beneficial in industries like construction, where project delays can
                    lead to significant financial losses.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Communication and Coordination:</strong> By providing a visual representation of
                    the project plan, CPM and PERT enhance communication among team members and stakeholders. Everyone
                    involved can understand the project’s flow, dependencies, and critical activities, leading to better
                    coordination. For instance, in large infrastructure projects, these techniques help align
                    contractors, suppliers, and clients on the same page.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Evaluation:</strong> These methods serve as excellent tools for evaluating
                    project performance by comparing planned progress with actual progress. Deviations from the schedule
                    can be identified early, allowing project managers to take corrective actions. In IT projects, for
                    instance, this ensures that milestones are met and deliverables are completed as promised.</li>

            <h2>Network Diagram</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In order to solve the problem of CPM and PERT we must understand how to construct a network diagram
                </li>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Rules for Network Construction:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>No Two Activities Should Have Same Starting and Ending Event:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each event in the network diagram must have a unique start and end point. If two activities
                            share the same start and end points, this is not allowed.</li>
                        <li>Solution: Use dummy activities to avoid this overlap.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../../images/ot7.jpeg" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>Activities Must Follow Precedence:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Activities are to be arranged in a logical order based on their precedence (i.e., some
                            activities can only start once others are finished). For example, Activity B can only start
                            after Activity A is completed. This relationship is crucial in the diagram construction.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../../images/ot8.jpeg" alt="">

                <li>Use of Dummy Activities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A dummy activity is an activity that doesn’t consume time or resources. It’s used to show
                            the logical relationship between activities when they can't directly be connected due to
                            precedence constraints.</li>
                        <li>Dummy activities are drawn using dashed lines and serve the sole purpose of maintaining
                            correct precedence.</li>

                <img src="../../images/ot13.jpeg" alt="Network diagram">
                <p>Now that our network construction is complete, we need to number the events. The numbering of events
                    is done using <strong>Fulkerson's Rule</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Fulkerson's Rule Steps:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by identifying the initial event, which has all outgoing arrows and no incoming arrows.
                        This event is numbered as 1. For example, in the network, the first node with only outgoing
                        arrows is labeled as event 1.</li>
                    <li>Next, delete all the outgoing arrows from this numbered event. By doing so, new nodes in the
                        network will now become initial events—nodes with outgoing arrows and no incoming arrows. These
                        newly identified initial events are then numbered sequentially, such as 2, 3, etc.</li>
                    <li>For each node you process, continue deleting the outgoing arrows from the numbered events to
                        reveal more initial events. For instance, if event 1 is processed and its outgoing arrows are
                        erased, event 2 might appear as the next initial event. Similarly, event 3 could emerge once its
                        preceding arrows are removed.</li>
                    <li>In cases where dummy arrows or unique dependencies exist, these are treated carefully. The
                        numbering proceeds only when the dummy arrows or specific conditions are cleared, ensuring the
                        correct sequence of events.</li>
                    <li>Repeat this process until you reach the final or terminal node. This node is unique as it has
                        all incoming arrows and no outgoing arrows. The final event is assigned the last number in the
                        sequence.</li>

                    They are critical in the sense that a delay in any of them results in a delay in the completion of

                    <li>Network Diagram:
                        <br><img src="../../images/ot16.jpeg" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now that we have drawn the network diagram, the next step is to calculate the earliest and latest times for each event.
                        <br>To calculate the <strong>earliest time</strong>, we use the <strong>forward pass method</strong>. In this method:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start from the initial node (starting point) of the network.</li>
                            <li>As you move to the next node, add the duration of the corresponding activity to the earliest time of the current node.</li>
                            <li>If there are multiple incoming activities to a node, select the maximum of the calculated times as the earliest time for that node.</li>
                        </ul>
                        To calculate the <strong>latest time</strong>, we use the <strong>backward pass method</strong>. In this method:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start from the final node (ending point) of the network and assign it the same value as its earliest time.</li>
                            <li>As you move backward to the preceding nodes, subtract the duration of the corresponding activity from the latest time of the current node.</li>
                            <li>If there are multiple outgoing activities from a node, select the minimum of the calculated times as the latest time for that node.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The earliest and latest times help determine the <strong>total float</strong> of each activity, which is the difference between the latest time and the earliest time. Activities with zero float are critical and form the <strong>critical path</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>E<sub>6</sub> is the completion of the project.</li>
                    <li>Now we have found earlest and latest time for each node now we check at which node value of E and L are same:
                        <br>[L1 = 0 = E1], [L2 = 8 = E2], [L4 = 18 = E4] and [E6 = 18 = L6]
                        <br>Now joining them we will get our critical  path.
                        <br>So Critical Path = 1 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 5 &rarr; 6 
                        <br>in terms of activites critical path = A &rarr; D &rarr; F &rarr; I.
