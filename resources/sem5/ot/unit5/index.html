            <h2>Network Analysis: CPM and PERT</h2>
            <p>Network analysis is a method used in project management to plan, schedule, and control complex projects.
                Two of the most popular techniques under network analysis are the Critical Path Method (CPM) and the
                Performance Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT). These techniques help project managers in managing
                their projects effectively by providing tools to visualize tasks, time estimates, and resources.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Key Terms in Network Analysis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Activity:</strong> An activity is any task or work that needs to be done in a project.
                        It's a part of the project that consumes time and resources (such as manpower, materials, money,
                        etc.). It is represented by an arrow in network diagrams.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event (or Node):</strong> An event is a milestone or a point in time that marks the
                        beginning or end of an activity. Events do not consume time or resources and are represented as
                        circles or nodes in a network diagram.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network:</strong> A network is a graphical representation that shows the sequence and
                        logical relationship between activities and events in a project. It is also known as an arrow
                        diagram, where arrows represent activities, and circles represent events.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>What is a Project?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Project:</strong> A project is a collection of interrelated tasks that need to be
                        executed in a specific order to achieve a goal. Projects usually have a clear objective, and the
                        activities must be planned in sequence to avoid delays or inefficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basic Requirements of a Project:</strong> A project must be completed on time, with
                        minimal use of resources and investment. Managing these requirements is key to project success.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Phases of Project Management</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Project Planning:</strong> This is the first phase where the project is broken down into
                        individual tasks or activities. You will also determine time estimates for each task and
                        establish the precedence relationships between tasks (which tasks need to be completed before
                        others).</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Scheduling:</strong> In this phase, you calculate the exact start and finish
                        times for each activity. You also determine the earliest and latest times at which the project’s
                        events can occur.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Controlling:</strong> This phase involves reviewing the progress of the project
                        by comparing the actual work accomplished with the scheduled work. If there are any deviations,
                        the schedule is updated accordingly to keep the project on track.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Understanding CPM (Critical Path Method)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CPM:</strong> The Critical Path Method is an activity-oriented technique, meaning it
                        focuses on activities and their relationships. It is a deterministic model, meaning it provides
                        a fixed time estimate for the completion of each activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fixed Time:</strong> In CPM, each activity has a fixed time duration. The method works
                        best when the duration of activities is well-known and does not vary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetitive Projects:</strong> CPM is commonly used for projects with repetitive tasks,
                        such as the construction of buildings or bridges. The time for each activity can be predicted
                        with certainty.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Understanding PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pert:</strong> The Program Evaluation and Review Technique is an event-oriented network
                        method. It focuses on the events (milestones) that occur between activities. PERT is a
                        probabilistic model, which means it accounts for uncertainty in activity durations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Range of Time:</strong> Unlike CPM, PERT uses a range of time estimates for activities,
                        typically based on optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely scenarios. This helps in estimating
                        the likelihood of completing the project within a certain time frame.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-repetitive Projects:</strong> PERT is used for non-repetitive or one-time projects
                        where the duration of tasks is uncertain. Examples include launching a satellite or conducting
                        research projects.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>CPM vs PERT: Key Differences</h3>
                <img src="../../images/ot12.jpeg" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Application of CMP & PERT:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Project Scheduling:</strong> CPM and PERT are widely used for scheduling complex projects by dividing them into smaller, manageable activities. These techniques enable project managers to visualize the sequence of tasks, determine the starting and ending times for each, and ensure that the project stays on track. For instance, in construction projects or event planning, they help identify dependencies and allocate resources efficiently to minimize delays. By offering a structured timeline, CPM and PERT make it easier to monitor progress and adjust schedules if unexpected issues arise.</li>
                <li><strong>Identifying the Critical Path:</strong> One of the key advantages of CPM and PERT is their ability to identify the critical path. This path represents the sequence of tasks that directly impacts the project's completion time. By focusing on these critical activities, project managers can prioritize resources and ensure that any delays on the critical path are addressed promptly. This feature is especially useful in projects where time is a significant constraint, such as launching a product or completing a public infrastructure project.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> These techniques help in optimizing the allocation of resources like manpower, machinery, and materials. CPM is particularly effective in balancing resource usage by identifying periods of high demand and adjusting schedules to avoid overuse or underutilization. For example, in manufacturing, CPM ensures that machines and workforce are used effectively without unnecessary downtime or bottlenecks.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> PERT excels in scenarios involving uncertainty by incorporating three time estimates—optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely. This allows project managers to assess risks and prepare contingency plans. In research and development projects, where timelines are often uncertain, PERT provides a realistic understanding of potential delays and helps in mitigating their impact on the overall schedule.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Control:</strong> Both CPM and PERT facilitate cost management by highlighting areas where savings can be achieved. CPM, in particular, helps identify opportunities for "crashing" activities, where additional resources can be allocated to shorten the timeline without exceeding the budget. This is especially beneficial in industries like construction, where project delays can lead to significant financial losses.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Communication and Coordination:</strong> By providing a visual representation of the project plan, CPM and PERT enhance communication among team members and stakeholders. Everyone involved can understand the project’s flow, dependencies, and critical activities, leading to better coordination. For instance, in large infrastructure projects, these techniques help align contractors, suppliers, and clients on the same page.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Evaluation:</strong> These methods serve as excellent tools for evaluating project performance by comparing planned progress with actual progress. Deviations from the schedule can be identified early, allowing project managers to take corrective actions. In IT projects, for instance, this ensures that milestones are met and deliverables are completed as promised.</li>

            <h2>Network Diagram</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In order to solve the problem of CPM and PERT we must understand how to construct a network diagram
                </li>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Rules for Network Construction:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>No Two Activities Should Have Same Starting and Ending Event:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each event in the network diagram must have a unique start and end point. If two activities share the same start and end points, this is not allowed.</li>
                        <li>Solution: Use dummy activities to avoid this overlap.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../../images/ot7.jpeg" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>Activities Must Follow Precedence:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Activities are to be arranged in a logical order based on their precedence (i.e., some activities can only start once others are finished). For example, Activity B can only start after Activity A is completed. This relationship is crucial in the diagram construction.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../../images/ot8.jpeg" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>Use of Dummy Activities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A dummy activity is an activity that doesn’t consume time or resources. It’s used to show the logical relationship between activities when they can't directly be connected due to precedence constraints.</li>
                        <li>Dummy activities are drawn using dashed lines and serve the sole purpose of maintaining correct precedence.</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>Single Representation of Each Activity:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each activity should be represented only once in the network diagram.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>One Starting and One Ending Event:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The network should have one single starting event (no multiple starting points) and one single ending event (no multiple finishing points). This ensures clarity in the project flow.</li>
