        <h1>Public Key Encryption</h1>
        <p>Public Key Encryption, also known as Asymmetric Key Cryptography, is a foundational concept in modern
            cryptography that enables secure communication over insecure channels. Unlike Symmetric Key Cryptography,
            where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, Public Key Encryption uses a pair of keys: a
            public key (used for encryption) and a private key (used for decryption). This revolutionary concept has
            made it possible for individuals and organizations to securely exchange sensitive information without the
            need for a pre-shared secret key, making it an essential tool for secure online transactions, email
            encryption, and digital signatures.</p>
        <p><strong>This topic is divided into several critical areas, each building upon the concept of public key
                encryption and its various applications:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Difference Between Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Cryptosystems: This section explores the fundamental
                differences between symmetric (or secret-key) cryptosystems and asymmetric (or public-key)
                cryptosystems. Symmetric systems use a single key for both encryption and decryption, which requires
                secure key exchange mechanisms. In contrast, asymmetric systems solve this problem by using two keys: a
                public key, which can be freely shared, and a private key, which remains confidential. Understanding
                these differences is crucial for grasping the strengths and limitations of each approach in real-world
                cryptographic applications.</li>
            <li>Public-Key Cryptography: The heart of the topic, public-key cryptography, encompasses the principles
                that underpin asymmetric encryption systems. Public-key systems rely on the mathematical properties of
                numbers and their operations to create secure systems. This section covers key cryptosystems used in
                real-world applications:
                <ul>
                    <li>Principles of Public-Key Cryptosystems: These are the core concepts that explain how asymmetric
                        encryption works, including how public and private keys interact, and the role of mathematical
                        functions in providing security.</li>
                    <li>RSA Algorithm: One of the most widely used public-key cryptosystems, RSA relies on the
                        difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. It is the basis for securing web traffic (e.g.,
                        SSL/TLS), digital signatures, and more.</li>
                    <li>Rabin Cryptosystem: A less well-known but important cryptosystem, Rabin's method is based on the
                        difficulty of extracting square roots modulo large primes, and its security parallels RSA in
                        some ways.</li>
                    <li>ElGamal Cryptosystem: Another key public-key cryptosystem, ElGamal is based on the
                        Diffie-Hellman key exchange and provides both encryption and digital signatures.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Key Management: Key management refers to the processes and techniques involved in creating,
                distributing, storing, and updating cryptographic keys in a secure manner. Proper key management is
                crucial for maintaining the security of a cryptographic system, as the security of encrypted data is
                only as strong as the protection of the keys used to encrypt it.</li>
            <li>Public Key Distribution: Public key distribution deals with the problem of securely sharing public keys
                across an insecure network. Even though the public key is not secret, it must be delivered in such a way
                that an attacker cannot substitute a fake key. Various methods, such as certificates issued by a trusted
                Certificate Authority (CA), are used to ensure that the recipient is truly receiving the intended public
                key.</li>
            <li>Mathematical Foundations: The security of public-key cryptosystems is deeply rooted in number theory,
                particularly in the use of certain mathematical theorems that make encryption difficult to break:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fermat’s Theorem: Fermat's Little Theorem provides the basis for many public-key algorithms,
                        such as RSA, by asserting properties of numbers in modular arithmetic, particularly in prime
                        number fields.</li>
                    <li>Euler’s Theorem: This theorem extends Fermat’s work and is used in algorithms like RSA for key
                        generation, ensuring that decryption works correctly by defining the relationship between the
                        totient of a number and modular exponentiation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

                RSA algorithm cryptography ki duniya mein ek important aur widely-used algorithm hai, jo secure
                communication ko ensure karta hai, khaas kar internet par. Yeh algorithm apne inventors ke naam par
                rakha gaya hai: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, aur Leonard Adleman. RSA ek asymmetric encryption method hai, jo
                symmetric systems se thoda alag hota hai. Symmetric systems mein sender aur receiver ke beech ek common
                key hoti hai, lekin RSA mein do keys hoti hain: ek public key aur ek private key. Is keys ka separation
                extra layer of security provide karta hai, aur isi wajah se RSA ek trusted aur secure encryption method

                Rabin Cryptosystem ek aur tarah ka asymmetric encryption hai, jo apne inventor Michael Rabin ke naam par
                rakha gaya hai. Iska introduction 1979 mein hua tha. RSA ki tarah, Rabin Cryptosystem bhi public aur
                private keys ka use karta hai secure communication ke liye, lekin iska mathematical foundation thoda
                alag hai.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rabin Cryptosystem quadratic residues aur large numbers ko factor karne ki difficulty par based hai.
                Iska security model quadratic residuosity problem ke difficult hone par depend karta hai. Yeh problem
                computationally hard maana jaata hai, bilkul waise hi jaise RSA ka security model large integers ko
                factor karne ki difficulty par based hai.

                <h3>What is the Rabin Cryptosystem?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mathematical Foundation:</strong> Rabin Cryptosystem ek asymmetric encryption algorithm
                        hai jo quadratic residues ke concept par based hai. Simple bhaasha mein, quadratic residues woh
                        numbers hote hain jo kisi integer ko square karne ke baad modulo kisi number ke equal hote hain.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Hard Problem:</strong> Rabin Cryptosystem is baat ka faayda uthata hai ki agar ek number
                        \(y\) diya ho, toh iska square root modulo ek large prime number \(p\) dhoondhna kaafi mushkil
                        hota hai. Yehi quadratic residuosity problem hai.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Generation:</strong> Rabin Cryptosystem modular arithmetic aur prime numbers ka use
                        karta hai, aur key generation ka process RSA se similar hota hai. Lekin encryption aur
                        decryption ka method dono algorithms mein alag hota hai.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Why is the Rabin Cryptosystem Important?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> Bilkul RSA ki tarah, Rabin Cryptosystem bhi untrusted
                        networks par secure communication ko enable karta hai. Yeh particularly useful hai jab message
                        interception ka risk ho.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Encryption:</strong> Rabin Cryptosystem ka encryption process RSA ke
                        comparison mein zyada efficient hota hai, kyunki isme kam operations lagte hain. Yeh faster ho
                        sakta hai kuch specific cases mein.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple Mathematical Operations:</strong> RSA ke complex operations ke mukable, Rabin
                        Cryptosystem ki mathematical operations relatively simple hote hain, jo isse samajhne aur
                        implement karne mein helpful banate hain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Halaanki Rabin Cryptosystem theoretically kaafi strong hai, iska
                        ek limitation hai decryption ambiguity. Iska matlab hai ki ek encrypted message ko decrypt karne
                        par ek se zyada possible outputs aa sakte hain. Yeh limitation iska usage real-world
                        applications mein restrict karta hai, lekin yeh cryptography ke theoretical studies ke liye ek
                        important system hai.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>How Does the Rabin Cryptosystem Work?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Generation:</strong> The first step is generating the public and private keys. The
                        process goes like this:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose a large prime \( p \). Select a large prime number \( p
                                \). This number should be large enough (at least 512 bits) to ensure security. Example:
                                \( p = 3233 \).</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Calculate the Public Key. The public key in Rabin’s system
                                consists of the prime number \( p \) that you’ve selected. The public key is simply \( p
                                \). Public Key: \( (p) \).</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Compute the Private Key. The private key is computed by
                                selecting a number \( x \) that is the square root modulo \( p \). This \( x \) is kept
                                secret. To find \( x \), solve the equation \( x^2 \equiv m \pmod{p} \) for some message
                                \( m \), where \( m \) is a number between 0 and \( p-1 \). This step is mathematically
                                challenging, which is why this system works on the assumption that finding square roots
                                modulo a large prime is computationally difficult. Private Key: \( x \).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Encryption in the Rabin Cryptosystem is done using the public key.
                        Here’s how encryption works:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Represent the Message. The message to be encrypted, \( m \), is
                                represented as a number. This number should be less than \( p \). Example: Suppose we
                                want to encrypt \( m = 123 \).</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Compute the Ciphertext. The ciphertext \( C \) is computed as
                                the square of the message \( m \) modulo \( p \):
                                \[
                                C = m^2 \mod p
                                \]
                                Example: Suppose \( p = 3233 \) and \( m = 123 \), then the ciphertext is:
                                \[
                                C = 123^2 \mod 3233 = 15129 \mod 3233 = 2130
                                \]
                                The ciphertext \( C = 2130 \) is then sent to the receiver.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Decryption:</strong> Decryption is where things get interesting in the Rabin
                        Cryptosystem. Here’s the tricky part: while encryption is simple, decryption can result in
                        multiple possible messages because of the properties of squaring numbers.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the Private Key to Find the Square Root. The receiver,
                                using their private key, tries to compute the square roots of the ciphertext modulo \( p
                                \). Since squaring is a many-to-one function (i.e., multiple numbers can have the same
                                square modulo \( p \)), the decryption process might yield two possible values for the
                                original message. This ambiguity means there are two possible messages for each
                                ciphertext, which is a problem in certain situations.
                                Example: Suppose the ciphertext is \( C = 2130 \). The receiver calculates the square
                                roots of \( C \) modulo \( p \). This process may yield two values, say \( m_1 \) and \(
                                m_2 \), both of which could be potential original messages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Handle the Ambiguity. In the Rabin Cryptosystem, decryption
                                typically results in two possible values for the original message. The receiver needs to
                                rely on other means (e.g., context, checksums, or error-correction codes) to figure out
                                which one is the correct message.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Why is the Rabin Cryptosystem Secure?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Rabin Cryptosystem’s security is based on the quadratic residuosity problem. Given a number
                        \( y \), it’s computationally hard to find an integer \( x \) such that:
                        \[
                        x^2 \equiv y \pmod{p}
                        \]
                        where \( p \) is a large prime number. This makes it extremely difficult for an attacker to

                    <li>The strength of the Rabin Cryptosystem comes from the fact that solving quadratic equations

                <h3>Strengths of the Rabin Cryptosystem</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The encryption process is very fast because squaring a number
                        modulo a large prime is computationally efficient.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The mathematical operations involved (square modulo a prime) are
                        relatively simple compared to more complex systems like RSA.</li>
                    <li><strong>Theoretical Significance:</strong> It provides an alternative to RSA based on a
                        different hard problem (quadratic residuosity).</li>

                <h3>Weaknesses of the Rabin Cryptosystem</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decryption Ambiguity:</strong> The most significant issue is that decryption leads to
                        two possible plaintexts. This means that the system isn’t fully reliable for general encryption
                        unless additional measures are taken to handle this ambiguity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Use:</strong> Due to the ambiguity in decryption, Rabin is less commonly used
                        than RSA. It’s mainly of interest in theoretical cryptography or in special cases where the
                        ambiguity can be managed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Size:</strong> Like RSA, Rabin requires large prime numbers for security, which
                        increases computational costs for key generation.</li>

                <h3>Applications of the Rabin Cryptosystem</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Research in Cryptography:</strong> Though not widely used in practice, it’s an important
                        theoretical cryptosystem in the study of number-theoretic problems and public-key cryptography.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Systems:</strong> Rabin could potentially be used in conjunction with other
                        cryptosystems for specialized tasks, where its decryption ambiguity can be mitigated.</li>

            <h2>ElGamal Cryptosystem</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The ElGamal Cryptosystem is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that was introduced by Taher ElGamal
                    in 1985. Like RSA and the Rabin Cryptosystem, ElGamal uses a pair of keys: a public key for
                    encryption and a private key for decryption. What sets ElGamal apart is its reliance on the
                    mathematical problem of discrete logarithms, which is a well-known mathematical problem believed to
                    be computationally hard.</li>
                <li>The ElGamal system is widely used in various cryptographic applications, especially in digital
                    signatures and public-key encryption. It is known for being probabilistic, which means it adds
                    randomness to the encryption process, making it more secure compared to deterministic systems like
                    RSA.</li>
                <li>At its core, the ElGamal Cryptosystem provides secure communication by using the principles of
                    public-key cryptography. It works by transforming a plaintext message into ciphertext in a way
                    that’s computationally difficult to reverse without knowing the private key.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Why is the ElGamal Cryptosystem Important?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ElGamal Cryptosystem is significant because it offers semantic security, which means that
                        even if an attacker intercepts the ciphertext, they cannot gain any meaningful information about
                        the original message without the private key.</li>
                    <li>What makes ElGamal important?
                        <ol>
                            <li>Security Foundation: The security of ElGamal is based on the discrete logarithm problem,
                                which is considered difficult to solve, making the system secure.</li>
                            <li>Versatility: ElGamal is used not only for encryption but also for creating digital
                                signatures. This means it can be employed in a wide range of cryptographic applications.
                            </li>
                            <li>Foundation for Other Systems: ElGamal has laid the groundwork for other cryptographic
                                protocols like the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and is used in hybrid systems
                                combining asymmetric and symmetric encryption techniques.</li>

                <h3>How Does the ElGamal Cryptosystem Work?</h3>
                <p>The ElGamal Cryptosystem consists of three main stages: Key Generation, Encryption, and Decryption.
                    Each of these stages uses modular arithmetic, and it relies on the difficulty of solving the
                    discrete logarithm problem. Let’s go through them in detail:</p>
                <div class="in">
                    <h3>1. Key Generation</h3>
                    <p>The first step in the ElGamal Cryptosystem is generating the public and private keys. Here’s how
                        the key generation process works:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step 1: Choose a Large Prime \( p \)</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Select a large prime number \( p \), which will serve as the modulus for the system.
                                    The size of \( p \) determines the strength of the cryptosystem.</li>
                                <li>Example: \( p = 353 \).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Step 2: Choose a Primitive Root \( g \) Modulo \( p \)</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Select a number \( g \) (called a generator or primitive root) that is a generator
                                    of the multiplicative group of integers modulo \( p \). This means that \( g \) has
                                    the property that its powers generate all the integers from 1 to \( p-1 \) when
                                    taken modulo \( p \).</li>
                                <li>Example: If \( p = 353 \), then \( g = 3 \) might be a valid primitive root modulo
                                    \( p \).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Step 3: Choose a Secret Private Key \( x \)</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Select a private key \( x \), which is a secret random number. This key will be kept
                                    private by the user.</li>
                                <li>Example: \( x = 123 \).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Step 4: Compute the Public Key</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Calculate the public key \( h \) using the formula:

                                    h = g^x \mod p
                                    \]
                                </li>
                                <li>The public key consists of the triplet \( (p, g, h) \), where \( p \) is the prime
                                    modulus, \( g \) is the primitive root, and \( h \) is the result of raising \( g \)
                                    to the power of the private key \( x \).</li>
                                <li>Example:
                                    \[
                                    h = 3^{123} \mod 353 = 179
                                    \]
                                    Public Key: \( (p, g, h) = (353, 3, 179) \).<br>
                                    Private Key: \( x = 123 \).

                    <p>Once the public key is available, encryption can be done by anyone who wants to send a message
                        securely. Here’s how encryption works:</p>
                    <ul>

                                    \( p \). This can be done by converting text to ASCII codes or using other encoding
                                    schemes.</li>
                                <li>Example: Let’s say the message \( m = 42 \).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Step 2: Choose a Random Number \( y \)</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Select a random number \( y \) that is less than \( p-1 \). This random number adds
                                    probabilistic encryption, meaning it will make each encryption of the same message
                                    result in a different ciphertext.</li>

            <h2>Key Management</h2>
            <p>
                In the world of cryptography, key management is one of the most crucial aspects of securing information.
                It refers to the set of processes and technologies used to generate, distribute, store, use, rotate,
                and eventually dispose of cryptographic keys. Without effective key management, even the most advanced
                encryption algorithms can be rendered useless.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think of cryptographic keys as the "passwords" that unlock encrypted data. The management of these keys
                is as important as the strength of the encryption itself. A weak, lost, or compromised key can
                jeopardize
                the security of an entire system. Therefore, key management ensures that keys remain safe, accessible
                only
                to authorized users, and used correctly within cryptographic protocols.
            </p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Why is Key Management Important?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Confidentiality is maintained: No unauthorized person should access the keys.</li>
                    <li>Integrity is preserved: Keys must not be altered or corrupted.</li>
                    <li>Availability is ensured: Authorized users must have access to the keys when needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Inadequate key management can lead to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data breaches if keys are stolen.</li>
                    <li>Loss of data if keys are lost or corrupted.</li>
                    <li>Non-compliance with industry regulations and standards like GDPR, PCI-DSS, or FIPS.</li>
                </ul>

                            <li>Keys are generated using secure algorithms (e.g., RSA, AES, ECC) to ensure they are
                                random and unique.</li>
                            <li>This process should occur in a trusted and controlled environment, often using
                                specialized hardware like HSMs (Hardware Security Modules).</li>

                can communicate securely. You might be wondering, "What’s a public key, and why do I need to distribute
                it?" Let’s back up a bit to understand this better.</p>
            <p>Remember from our earlier conversation about asymmetric cryptography? In that system, there are two keys:
                a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt messages, and the private key is used
                to decrypt them. The trick with public key cryptography is that you can share your public key with
                anyone, but you must keep your private key secret. This allows people to send you encrypted messages
                without needing to worry about someone intercepting the key—because the private key is only with you.
            </p>
            <p>But here's the catch: To encrypt a message to you, someone needs your public key. And this is where
                public key distribution comes in. It’s all about making sure that the public key gets to the right
                person, and it happens in a way that is secure and reliable. Without it, you could give your public key
                to the wrong person (a hacker), and they could impersonate you or intercept your messages.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Why is Public Key Distribution Important?</h3>
                <p>When you want someone to send you a confidential message, you need them to have your public key so
                    they can encrypt their message for you. But you can't just post your public key on a billboard or
                    send it through a regular email—it needs to be authentic. If someone else gets a hold of your public
                    key and pretends to be you, they could trick others into sending sensitive information to them.</p>
                <p>So, the main goal of public key distribution is to ensure that when people get your public key,
                    they’re sure it actually belongs to you and hasn’t been tampered with by a third party. It needs to
                    be trusted and verified.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>How Does Public Key Distribution Work?</h3>
                <p>Now that we know why it’s important, let’s look at how public key distribution happens. There are a
                    few different methods to distribute public keys securely:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Manual Distribution:</strong> The simplest way is for you to physically hand someone
                        your public key. For example, if you’re meeting someone in person, you could give them a USB
                        drive with your public key on it. This way, you control the transfer of the key, and you know
                        it’s safe. However, this method isn’t very practical for large-scale systems or for people who
                        are far away from each other. Plus, it doesn’t scale well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):</strong> PKI is a more sophisticated system for
                        distributing public keys. It involves Certificate Authorities (CAs), which are trusted
                        organizations that issue digital certificates. These certificates verify that a public key
                        belongs to a specific person or organization. When you want to send an encrypted message to
                        someone, you can trust the CA’s certificate to make sure the public key really belongs to the
                        person you’re trying to communicate with. Think of it like getting a government-issued ID card.
                        If you show your ID to someone, they know it’s authentic because the government verified it.
                        Similarly, a CA verifies the public key’s authenticity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Servers:</strong> Another way to distribute public keys is through key servers,
                        which are online directories where people can upload and download public keys. When you want to
                        find someone’s public key, you can search for it on the key server. The key servers make it easy
                        to distribute and manage public keys, but they rely on being trustworthy sources, just like the
                        CAs. One popular system that uses key servers is PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), which is used for
                        encrypting emails and files.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web of Trust:</strong> The Web of Trust is a more decentralized way of distributing
                        public keys. Instead of relying on a central authority like a CA, individuals personally verify
                        each other’s public keys. When you meet someone you trust, you can exchange and verify public
                        keys directly. This can create a network of trust between individuals, forming a "web." PGP also
                        uses this method, where users can sign each other's public keys to vouch for their authenticity.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>How Do You Know a Public Key is Legitimate?</h3>
                <p>One of the challenges with public key distribution is verifying that the public key you receive is
                    authentic. If someone intercepts a public key during distribution, they could give you their own key
                    instead. This is where digital certificates and signature verification come into play.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Digital Certificates:</strong> When you download a public key from a trusted source
                        (like a CA or key server), the key is often bundled with a digital certificate. This certificate
                        proves that the public key belongs to the person or organization that it claims to. The
                        certificate is signed by a trusted third party, ensuring its legitimacy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> If you’ve received a public key from someone, they can also
                        sign the key with their private key. This helps you confirm that the key really belongs to them
                        and hasn’t been tampered with.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>What Are the Risks of Public Key Distribution?</h3>
                <p>Even though public key distribution is a great way to enable secure communication, it’s not without
                    risks. Some potential risks include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:</strong> If an attacker intercepts your public key while it’s
                        being sent and replaces it with their own, they could decrypt the message before passing it on
                        to the real recipient. This is why it’s so important to use trusted methods like digital
                        certificates or key servers for distribution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fake Certificates:</strong> If a CA is compromised or unreliable, they might issue fake
                        certificates that authenticate fraudulent public keys. This can be a big security issue, which
                        is why many systems constantly monitor and validate the reliability of CAs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Revocation:</strong> If your private key is ever compromised, it’s crucial to revoke
                        your public key. Public key distribution systems should have a way to revoke keys when necessary
                        to avoid further issues.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>What Are Mathematical Foundations in Cryptography?</h2>
            <p>When we talk about the mathematical foundations of cryptography, we’re referring to the basic
                mathematical principles and theorems that make modern cryptography work. Cryptography relies heavily on
                math to create secure systems for encrypting and decrypting information. Among the many mathematical
                tools used, number theory plays a big role because it helps us work with properties of numbers like
                divisibility, remainders, and modular arithmetic.</p>
            <p>Now, two key theorems—Fermat’s Little Theorem and Euler’s Theorem—are at the heart of these foundations.
                They’re essential for understanding how many cryptographic algorithms, like RSA, work. So, let’s break
                these down step by step.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Fermat’s Little Theorem</h3>
                <h4>What Is It?</h4>
                <p>Fermat’s Little Theorem is a simple yet powerful rule in number theory. It deals with prime numbers
                    and modular arithmetic. The theorem states:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    If <em>p</em> is a prime number and <em>a</em> is any integer such that <em>a</em> is not divisible
                    by <em>p</em>, then:<br>
                    <strong>a<sup>p−1</sup> ≡ 1 (mod p)</strong>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In simpler terms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take any number <em>a</em>.</li>
                    <li>Raise it to the power of <em>p−1</em>, where <em>p</em> is a prime number.</li>
                    <li>When you divide the result by <em>p</em>, the remainder will always be 1.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>Let’s take <em>a = 2</em> and <em>p = 7</em> (since 7 is a prime number).</p>
                <p>
                    2<sup>7−1</sup> = 2<sup>6</sup> = 64<br>
                    Now divide 64 by 7. The remainder is 1, so:<br>
                    <strong>2<sup>6</sup> ≡ 1 (mod 7)</strong>
                </p>
                <h4>Why Is This Useful?</h4>
                <p>Fermat’s Little Theorem helps us work with very large numbers in cryptography. Instead of directly
                    calculating massive powers, we can simplify them using modular arithmetic. This makes encryption and
                    decryption processes much faster and more efficient.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Euler’s Theorem</h3>
                <h4>What Is It?</h4>
                <p>Euler’s Theorem is a generalization of Fermat’s Little Theorem. It works not just for prime numbers
                    but for any integers that are coprime (two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor is
                    1). The theorem states:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    If <em>n</em> is a positive integer and <em>a</em> is an integer such that gcd(<em>a, n</em>) = 1,
                    then:<br>
                    <strong>a<sup>ϕ(n)</sup> ≡ 1 (mod n)</strong>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Here, ϕ(<em>n</em>) is called Euler’s totient function, which counts the number of integers less than
                    <em>n</em> that are coprime with <em>n</em>.
                </p>
                <h4>Totient Function:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>For a prime number <em>p</em>, ϕ(<em>p</em>) = <em>p−1</em> (because all numbers less than
                        <em>p</em> are coprime with <em>p</em>).
                    </li>
                    <li>For a composite number <em>n = p<sub>1</sub><sup>e<sub>1</sub></sup> ⋅
                            p<sub>2</sub><sup>e<sub>2</sub></sup> ⋅ …</em>,<br>
                        ϕ(<em>n</em>) = <em>n ⋅ (1−1/p<sub>1</sub>) ⋅ (1−1/p<sub>2</sub>) ⋅ …</em>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>Let’s take <em>n = 10</em> and <em>a = 3</em>.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Calculate ϕ(<em>10</em>):<br>
                        The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5.<br>
                        ϕ(<em>10</em>) = 10 ⋅ (1−1/2) ⋅ (1−1/5) = 10 ⋅ 1/2 ⋅ 4/5 = 4.
                    </li>
                    <li>Apply Euler’s Theorem:<br>
                        3<sup>ϕ(10)</sup> = 3<sup>4</sup> = 81.<br>
                        Divide 81 by 10: The remainder is 1, so:<br>
                        <strong>3<sup>4</sup> ≡ 1 (mod 10)</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Why Is This Useful?</h4>
                <p>Euler’s Theorem is a cornerstone of RSA encryption, where it ensures that encryption and decryption
                    operations work correctly. The totient function ϕ(<em>n</em>) plays a key role in generating secure
                    keys.</p>

                <h3>Key Differences Between Fermat’s and Euler’s Theorems</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scope:</strong><br>
                        Fermat’s Little Theorem applies only to prime numbers.<br>
                        Euler’s Theorem applies to any positive integer <em>n</em>, as long as <em>a</em> is coprime
                        with <em>n</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Basis:</strong><br>
                        Fermat’s Little Theorem is a special case of Euler’s Theorem where <em>n</em> is a prime number.
                        In that case, ϕ(<em>n</em>) = <em>n−1</em>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>How Are These Theorems Used in Cryptography?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RSA Algorithm:</strong><br>
                        Both theorems help us understand how modular exponentiation works, which is the backbone of RSA.
                        In RSA, ϕ(<em>n</em>) is used to generate the private and public keys securely.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Computation:</strong><br>
                        They allow us to simplify calculations involving very large numbers, which are common in
                        cryptography.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong><br>
                        The difficulty of reversing these calculations without the private key is what makes encryption
                        secure.
