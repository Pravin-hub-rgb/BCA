        <h1>Introduction to Cryptography</h1>
        <p>Cryptography is the science of securing communication by transforming readable data (plainli) into an
            unreadable form (cipherli). The goal is to ensure that only authorized users can access or understand the
            information, protecting it from unauthorized access. Cryptography plays a key role in securing data in our
            everyday lives, from email communication to online banking, ensuring that private information remains
            confidential and secure.</p>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Security Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Before understanding cryptographic attacks, it’s important to know the goals of security in
                    cryptography. These goals define what cryptographic methods aim to achieve when protecting data.
                    Without these goals, any effort to protect information becomes ineffective.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The three main security goals are confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The primary goal of confidentiality is to prevent unauthorized access to data. Only those
                            who have the right permissions should be able to view the information.</li>
                        <li>Example: Your password is encrypted when you log in to your email, ensuring that only you
                            and the system can access it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Integrity</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integrity ensures that the data remains unchanged and accurate. Any unauthorized
                            modifications to data should be detectable, and only authorized users should be able to make
                            changes.</li>
                        <li>Example: When sending important documents via email, the integrity goal ensures the document
                            isn’t altered during transmission.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Availability</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Availability ensures that authorized users can access the data or services when needed.
                            Attacks that limit access to resources can disrupt business operations and communication.
                        </li>
                        <li>Example: During a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, users may be unable to access a website
                            because the server is overwhelmed with traffic.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Classification of Cryptographic Attacks</h2>
            <p>Cryptographic attacks refer to attempts by attackers to compromise or break cryptographic systems. These
                attacks can be classified based on the security goal they target, the type of damage they cause, or the
                mathematical methods they exploit.</p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>1) Attacks Based on Security Goals They Impact</h3>
                <p>Each cryptographic attack is designed to target specific security goals, threatening the
                    confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data.</p>
                <h3>1. Confidentiality Attacks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Snooping:</strong> Unauthorized access to data without modifying it. The attacker reads
                        or monitors the information.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> Intercepting unencrypted emails to steal sensitive information
                        like PINs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Traffic Analysis:</strong> Monitoring traffic patterns (e.g., size, frequency) to gather
                        insights, even if data is encrypted.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> Monitoring encrypted military communications to predict troop
                        movements.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Integrity Attacks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Modification:</strong> Altering the contents of a message or file. Unauthorized changes
                        to data violate its integrity.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> Modifying a bank transaction to transfer money to the attacker’s
                        account.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Masquerading (Spoofing):</strong> The attacker pretends to be someone else to gain
                        unauthorized access.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> An attacker impersonates a system administrator to steal sensitive
                        data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Replay Attack:</strong> Re-transmitting a previously captured message to trick the
                        system into accepting it as legitimate.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> Re-sending a captured financial transaction to duplicate an
                        authorized payment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Repudiation:</strong> Denying having performed an action in communication, often leading
                        to disputes.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> A person denies having made an online payment, even though the
                        transaction was completed.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Availability Attacks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Denial of Service (DoS):</strong> Preventing legitimate users from accessing services by
                        overwhelming the system with excessive requests.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> Overloading a server with traffic, making a website unavailable to
                        users.
                    </li>
                </ul>


            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>2) Attacks Based on the Type of Damage</h3>
                <p>Cryptographic attacks can also be classified based on whether they involve directly damaging data or
                    simply stealing information without modification.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Active Attacks:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In active attacks, the attacker aims to modify or disrupt data and services, causing
                                harm to the system.</li>
                            <li>Example: An attacker intercepting and altering a message in transit to change the
                                meaning.</li>
                            <li>Security Goals Compromised: Integrity and Availability.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Passive Attacks:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In passive attacks, the attacker’s goal is to observe and collect information without
                                altering or disrupting the data.</li>
                            <li>Example: Monitoring network traffic to capture unencrypted usernames and passwords.</li>
                            <li>Security Goal Compromised: Confidentiality.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>3) Attacks Based on Mathematical Viewpoint (Cryptographic Attacks)</h3>
                <p>Cryptographic attacks can also exploit mathematical flaws in cryptographic algorithms. These types of
                    attacks are more technical and focus on breaking the encryption itself.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cryptoanalytic Attacks:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These attacks use mathematical techniques such as statistical analysis to find
                                vulnerabilities in cryptographic algorithms and deduce the secret key.</li>
                            <li>Example: Factoring large prime numbers to break the RSA encryption algorithm.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Non-cryptoanalytic Attacks:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These attacks don’t target the mathematical weaknesses of cryptography but exploit other
                                vulnerabilities, such as poor implementation or human error.</li>
                            <li>Example: Social engineering attacks where attackers trick users into revealing their
                                passwords.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Cryptoanalytic Attacks</h3>
                <p>Cryptoanalytic attacks focus on analyzing the encrypted data (cipherli) to extract information or
                    break the encryption without knowing the key.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cipherli-only Attack:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In this attack, the attacker only has access to the cipherli and tries to deduce the
                                encryption key or original message.</li>
                            <li>Example: Intercepting encrypted emails and trying to decrypt them using statistical
                                methods.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Known-plainli Attack:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Here, the attacker has access to both the plainli and its corresponding cipherli,
                                allowing them to analyze how the encryption process works.</li>
                            <li>Example: If an attacker knows a common word in a message, they can use that to decrypt
                                other parts of the message.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Chosen-plainli Attack:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The attacker chooses specific plainlis and encrypts them to study how the algorithm
                                works.</li>
                            <li>Example: Encrypting the word "password" using different encryption methods to study
                                patterns in the cipherli.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Chosen-cipherli Attack:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The attacker can select specific cipherlis and attempt to decrypt them, using the
                                results to understand the encryption system.</li>
                            <li>Example: Injecting fake cipherlis into a system to gather insights into its decryption
                                process.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Non-cryptoanalytic Attacks</h3>
                <p>Non-cryptoanalytic attacks focus on vulnerabilities outside the cryptographic algorithms, such as
                    poor security practices or flaws in the system setup.</p>

                <h2>Types of Cryptography</h2>
                <p>Cryptography is the practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format.
                    There are several types of cryptographic techniques, each serving different purposes and utilizing
                    various methods to ensure data security. The primary types of cryptography include symmetric
                    cryptography, asymmetric cryptography, and hash functions. Each type has its own unique features and
                    applications in securing digital communication and data.</p>

                <div class="in">
                    <h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>
                    <p>Symmetric cryptography, also known as secret key cryptography or private key cryptography, is a
                        straightforward encryption technique that uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
                        This means that the same key is used to transform plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. The
                        security of this method relies on keeping the key secret between the communicating parties.</p>
                    <p>The most popular symmetric key cryptography system is DES (Data Encryption Standard), which has
                        been widely used for securing data. However, due to advancements in computational power, DES has
                        been largely replaced by more secure algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).</p>

                    <h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>
                    <p>Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, utilizes two different keys for
                        encryption and decryption. One key, known as the public key, is shared openly and can be used by
                        anyone to encrypt data. The second key, known as the private key, is kept secret by the owner
                        and is used to decrypt the data that was encrypted with the corresponding public key.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Public Key: This key is widely distributed and available to anyone. It is used to encrypt
                            data.</li>
                        <li>Private Key: This key is kept confidential by the owner. It is used to decrypt data that was
                            encrypted with the corresponding public key.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> A message encrypted using a public key can only be decrypted using the
                        corresponding private key. Conversely, a message encrypted with a private key can only be
                        decrypted using the corresponding public key.</p>
                    <p>Popular asymmetric key algorithms include RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman), DSA (Digital Signature
                        Algorithm), and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).</p>

                    <h3>Hash Functions</h3>
                    <p>Hash functions are cryptographic algorithms that generate a fixed-size output (hash value) from
                        variable-size input data. The primary purpose of a hash function is to ensure data integrity by
                        producing a unique hash value for unique input data. Even a small change in the input data will
                        result in a significantly different hash value, making hash functions useful for detecting
                        alterations or corruption in data.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hash functions are one-way functions, meaning they cannot be reversed to retrieve the
                            original data from the hash value.</li>
                        <li>Common hash functions include MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5), SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm
                            1), and SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example: Password Storage and Verification</h4>
                    <p>When a user creates a password for their account, it is not stored directly in the database.
                        Instead, the password is processed through a hash function to produce a hash value. This hash
                        value is then stored in the database.</p>
                    <p>Here's how it works in practice:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>User Registration:</strong> When a user sets a password, the password is hashed
                            using a hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to produce a hash value. For example, if the password
                            is "mypassword", the hash function generates a hash value like
                            "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d" (this is just a sample hash).</li>
                        <li><strong>Storing the Hash:</strong> The resulting hash value is stored in the database, not
                            the actual password. This ensures that the plaintext password is not exposed even if the
                            database is compromised.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Login:</strong> When the user attempts to log in, they enter their password.
                            This password is again processed through the same hash function to produce a hash value.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> The hash value generated from the entered password is
                            compared with the hash value stored in the database. If the two hash values match, the
                            password is correct, and the user is granted access. If they do not match, access is denied.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>By using hash functions, passwords are kept secure and confidential, as the original password
                        cannot be directly retrieved from the hash value.</p>
