            <h2>Computing</h2>
            <p>Before diving into soft computing, it's essential to first understand what computing is and familiarize
                ourselves with the core terminologies related to computing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The following diagram represents the basic process that occurs in computing:</li>
            </ul>
<img src="../../images/sc2.jpeg" alt="">
            <ul>
                <li>In this diagram, we observe that there is a function, <strong>f</strong>, which takes some input,
                    <strong>x</strong>, and produces an output, <strong>y</strong>.
                    The input is referred to as the <strong>Antecedent</strong>, while the output is called the
                    <strong>Consequent</strong>.</li>
                <li>The function <strong>f</strong> can also be called a <strong>formal method</strong>,
                    <strong>algorithm</strong>, or a <strong>mapping function</strong>. It represents the logic or steps
                    used to process the input and generate the output.</li>
                <li>The middle part of this diagram is known as the <strong>computing unit</strong>, where the function
                    resides. This is where we feed the input, and a process occurs to convert that input into the
                    desired output <strong>y</strong>.</li>
                <li>In the computing process, the steps that guide how the input is manipulated are called
                    <strong>control actions</strong>. These control actions ensure that the input gradually approaches
                    the desired output. The moment the process completes, we obtain the final result, known as the
                    <strong>Consequent</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Characteristics Related to Computing:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Precise Solution:</strong> Computing is used to produce a solution that is exact and
                            definitive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unambiguous & Accurate:</strong> The control actions within the computing unit must
                            be unambiguous, meaning they must have only one interpretation. Each control action should
                            also be accurate to ensure that the process is valid and reliable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mathematical Model:</strong> A well-defined algorithm is a requirement for solving
                            any problem through computing. This algorithm is essentially a mathematical model that
                            represents the problem and its solution process.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Soft Computing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Soft Computing is an approach to computing that models the human mind’s ability to make decisions in
                    an uncertain, imprecise, or complex environment. Unlike traditional, or "hard," computing, which
                    relies on exact, binary logic (0s and 1s), soft computing deals with approximation, flexibility, and
                    learning from experience to solve complex real-world problems.</li>
                <li>Soft computing techniques focus on developing systems that can handle ambiguity, uncertainty, and
                    approximation, making them well-suited for fields like artificial intelligence (AI), pattern
                    recognition, and robotics.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Difference between Hard and Soft Computing</h3>

            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Requirement of Soft Computing</h3>
                <p>Soft computing is essential because many real-world problems are too complex for traditional
                    computing methods. Systems must handle:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uncertainty</strong>: Data may not always be precise, requiring flexible models.</li>
                    <li><strong>Partial truths</strong>: Situations where a simple binary "true/false" answer isn’t
                        sufficient.</li>
                    <li><strong>Imprecision</strong>: Many problems, such as human language processing, involve vague or
                        imprecise inputs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex systems</strong>: Soft computing helps in dealing with complex, non-linear
                        systems, like weather prediction or stock market analysis.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Major Areas of Soft Computing</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Fuzzy Logic</strong>: Mimics human reasoning, allowing for more than just "true" or
                        "false" outcomes. It’s widely used in control systems, such as thermostats or automated vehicle
                        systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neural Networks</strong>: Modeled after the human brain, these networks learn from data
                        and improve over time. They are used in areas like image recognition, speech processing, and
                        autonomous systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetic Algorithms</strong>: Inspired by natural selection, these algorithms "evolve"
                        solutions over generations. They are useful for optimization problems, such as route planning or
                        complex decision-making.</li>
                    <li><strong>Probabilistic Reasoning</strong>: Deals with uncertainty using probabilities. It is
                        useful in situations where outcomes are not deterministic, like predicting stock market trends
                        or diagnosing diseases.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Applications of Soft Computing</h3>
                <p>Soft computing techniques are applied in a variety of fields, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>: Many AI systems rely on neural networks and fuzzy
                        logic to emulate human decision-making.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pattern Recognition</strong>: Soft computing helps identify patterns in complex data,
                        such as handwriting recognition or facial recognition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Robotics</strong>: Soft computing enables robots to navigate environments with uncertain
                        data, making them more adaptable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Mining</strong>: Soft computing techniques are used to discover patterns and
                        relationships in large datasets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Systems</strong>: Fuzzy logic controllers are used in industrial systems, like
                        temperature control in manufacturing plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medicine</strong>: Soft computing helps in diagnosing diseases, predicting patient
                        outcomes, and optimizing treatment plans.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economics and Finance</strong>: Used in predicting market trends, risk analysis, and
                        portfolio optimization.</li>
