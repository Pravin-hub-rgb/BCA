            <ul>
                <li>First, we will understand where the concept of Genetic Algorithm originated from, then we will
                    explore why we are using Genetic Algorithms and how they work.</li>
                <li>The concept of Genetic Algorithms originates from Evolutionary Algorithms.</li>
                <li>
                    Evolutionary Algorithms are those algorithms that mimic certain biological and physical behaviors.
                    By simulating these natural behaviors, whether biological or physical, we have developed algorithms
                    that provide significant advantages for our computer systems. These algorithms help optimize
                    processes in our systems when simulated effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What are the biological behaviors that we can simulate in our computers:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Genetics and Evolution: These biological concepts form the foundation of the "Genetic
                            Algorithm." Therefore, we can say that Genetic Algorithms are a subset of Evolutionary
                            Algorithms.

                        <li>
                            Human Nervous System: This behavior has been used to develop Artificial Neural Networks,
                            which mimic the functioning of the human brain to solve complex problems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Behavior of Ant Colonies: By studying the behavior of ant colonies, we have developed the
                            Ant Colony Optimization technique, which is used for solving optimization problems like
                            finding the shortest path in networks.

                    Now, what are the physical behaviors that can be simulated:

                        <li>
                            Learning: The human learning system has been simulated to develop Fuzzy Logic, which helps
                            computers make decisions in uncertain environments.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Swarming of Particles: The concept of grouping particles has been utilized in the Particle
                            Swarm Optimization technique, which is used for solving optimization problems by simulating
                            the behavior of swarming particles.
