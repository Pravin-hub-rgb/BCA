                    Evolutionary Algorithms are those algorithms that mimic certain biological and physical behaviors.
                    By simulating these natural behaviors, whether biological or physical, we have developed algorithms
                    that provide significant advantages for our computer systems. These algorithms help optimize
                    processes in our systems when simulated effectively.

                            Algorithm." Therefore, we can say that Genetic Algorithms are a subset of Evolutionary
                            Algorithms.

                <h3>Genetic Algorithm Definition</h3>
                <p>
                    A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a subset of Evolutionary Algorithms that models biological processes,
                    such as genetics and evolution, to optimize highly complex functions.
                    These functions are often difficult to model mathematically, involve NP-hard problems (which are
                    computationally expensive to solve), or include a large number of parameters
                    that make traditional optimization techniques infeasible.

                <h3>Background of Genetic Algorithm (GA)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduced by Prof. John Holland from the University of Michigan, USA, in 1965.</li>
                    <li>The first detailed article on Genetic Algorithms was published in 1975 in his book
                        "<em>Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems</em>".</li>
                    <li>GA is based on two fundamental biological processes:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Genetics:</strong> A concept introduced by Gregor Johann Mendel in 1865, which
                                is the branch of biology that studies genes, genetic variation, and heredity in living
                                organisms.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Evolution:</strong> A theory proposed by Charles Darwin in 1859 in his book
                                "<em>On the Origin of Species</em>". Evolution describes how populations of organisms
                                change over generations through processes like natural selection and survival of the
                                fittest.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Genetics:</strong> Focuses on the transmission of genetic material (DNA) and how
                        variations occur in populations through mechanisms like mutation and recombination.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Evolution:</strong> Refers to the gradual process by which organisms develop and
                        diversify from earlier forms through natural selection, genetic drift, and adaptation.

                <h3>Genetic Algorithm Working Principles</h3>
                <p>
                    Until now, we have understood that Genetic Algorithms (GA) are inspired by genetics and evolution.
                    Now, we will dive deeper into these concepts to explore more terminologies and understand their
                    relevance to GAs.

                                it is an animal, a human, or any other living organism, cells form the foundational
                                structure of their bodies.

                                    <li>Mosquitoes: 6 chromosomes</li>

                                <strong>Chromosomes:</strong> Chromosomes are long strings of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic
                                Acid) that carry genetic information essential for the development and functioning of
                                living organisms.

                                <strong>Genes:</strong> Chromosomes are made up of smaller segments called genes, which
                                are the basic units of heredity.

                                <strong>Blocks of DNA:</strong> Genes are specific sequences within DNA that encode
                                instructions for particular traits or characteristics.

                <h3>Intuition Behind Genetic Algorithm:</h3>
                <p>
                    To understand the intuition behind Genetic Algorithms (GA), let us consider a hypothetical scenario.
                    Suppose we want to improve the overall population of a country by ensuring that only the best
                    individuals contribute to future generations. The process might work as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Select all the good people in the population based on specific criteria (e.g., honesty,
                        intelligence, or productivity) and allow only them to reproduce, extending their lineage to the
                        next generation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repeat this process over several generations, where only the individuals meeting the desired
                        criteria are allowed to pass on their traits.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Over time, the population evolves, and eventually, we end up with an entire generation of "good"
                        individuals who meet the desired standards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The fundamental idea is to introduce changes in the input (in this case, the population) to
                        achieve an improved output (a better society or country).
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Similarly, in a Genetic Algorithm, the "population" refers to a set of candidate solutions, and
                    "good individuals" represent the solutions with higher fitness. By iteratively selecting,
                    reproducing, and improving these solutions, GAs aim to optimize results and achieve the best
                    possible outcome for complex problems.
