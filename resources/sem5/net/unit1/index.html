                <h3>The Problem Before .NET</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Before .NET, developers faced many challenges when building software. They had to deal with:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Writing different code for different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
                            <li>Using different programming languages with no easy way to make them work together.</li>
                            <li>Managing DLL Hell, a problem where different applications required different versions of
                                the
                                same shared libraries, leading to conflicts.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Solution: Creation of .NET?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Microsoft wanted to create a platform that could solve these issues by:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allowing code to run on multiple platforms (not just Windows).</li>
                            <li>Supporting multiple programming languages in a single environment.</li>
                            <li>Simplifying how applications are developed, deployed, and maintained.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the year <strong>2000</strong>, Microsoft introduced the .NET Framework.</p>

                    <h3>What is .NET?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>.NET is a software framework, which is a collection of tools and libraries that help
                            developers
                            build different types of applications (like desktop apps, web apps, and mobile apps).</li>
                        <li>A framework is a collection of technologies integrated together to develop applications that
                            can
                            be executed anywhere.</li>

                    <h3>The Evolution of .NET</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Initially, the .NET Framework was designed for Windows-only applications. It included:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A runtime called Common Language Runtime (CLR), which ensured the applications could
                                    run
                                    efficiently.</li>
                                <li>A large set of libraries to help with tasks like connecting to databases and
                                    handling
                                    files.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The Shift to .NET Core (2016):
                            <ul>
                                <li>As technology advanced, developers needed a framework that could work on more than
                                    just
                                    Windows. Microsoft introduced .NET Core in 2016.</li>
                                <li>.NET Core was cross-platform, meaning you could use it to build apps for Windows,
                                    Linux,
                                    and macOS.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Unified .NET (2020 onwards):
                            <ul>
                                <li>In 2020, Microsoft released .NET 5, a unified version of .NET that merged the best
                                    features of both the .NET Framework and .NET Core.</li>
                                <li>Now, developers just refer to it as .NET, which works on all platforms.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="in">
                    <h3>Components Provided by .NET</h3>
                    <p>The .NET framework provides two main components:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>CLR (Common Language Runtime)</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>BCL (Base Class Library)</strong></li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>CLR (Common Language Runtime)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The CLR is the core runtime engine in the .NET framework responsible for executing
                            applications.
                        </li>
                        <li>When .NET code is compiled, it is transformed into an Intermediate Language (IL). The CLR
                            takes
                            this IL code and compiles it into native machine code that can be executed by the operating
                            system.
                            <br><img src="../../images/net1.jpeg" alt="">
                        </li>
                        <li>The CLR handles important tasks such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> The CLR allocates and deallocates memory for
                                    .NET
                                    applications through a process called garbage collection.</li>
                                <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> It ensures that code adheres to strict type safety
                                    rules,
                                    preventing unsafe operations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Exception Handling:</strong> The CLR provides a unified approach for
                                    handling
                                    runtime errors across different programming languages in .NET.</li>
                                <li><strong>Security:</strong> It enforces code access security, managing what
                                    permissions
                                    the application has while running.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>In short, the CLR is responsible for managing the execution of programs and providing
                            essential
                            services like memory management and security.</li>
                        <li>In the .NET framework, the code is compiled twice:
                            <ol>
                                <li>First, the source code is compiled by the respective language compiler, which
                                    generates
                                    intermediate code known as MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) or IL
                                    (Intermediate
                                    Language) or Managed Code.</li>
                                <li>Then, MSIL is converted into native code (code specific to the operating system)
                                    using
                                    the CLR.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>BCL (Base Class Library)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The BCL is a collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types provided by
                            Microsoft,
                            forming the foundation of all .NET applications.</li>
                        <li>It contains predefined classes and functions that provide common functionalities like:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>I/O operations:</strong> Handling input and output for file and stream
                                    manipulation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong> Offering standard data structures such as lists,
                                    dictionaries, queues, and more.</li>
                                <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Providing classes to work with network protocols like
                                    HTTP
                                    and FTP.</li>
                                <li><strong>Threading:</strong> Enabling support for multithreading and asynchronous
                                    programming.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The BCL acts as a library of building blocks that developers can use to avoid rewriting
                            common
                            tasks from scratch, ensuring consistency across different applications.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How CLR and BCL Work Together</h3>
                    <p>The CLR and BCL work in harmony to provide an efficient execution environment for .NET
                        applications:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When a .NET application is compiled, the IL code references classes from the BCL. The BCL
                            provides all the fundamental functionality needed to perform standard operations such as
                            file
                            handling, data manipulation, and more.</li>
                        <li>The CLR takes this IL code and, at runtime, loads the necessary BCL components needed by the
                            application. For example, if your code uses a `List`, the CLR loads the `List` class from
                            the
                            BCL.</li>
                        <li>The CLR also manages memory allocation and garbage collection for objects created using the
                            BCL
                            types, ensuring that memory is efficiently managed.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, the CLR enforces security and type safety when the application interacts with
                            BCL
                            components, preventing unsafe memory access or unauthorized operations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In summary, the BCL provides the necessary libraries for application development, while the CLR
                        handles the runtime execution, memory management, and security, ensuring that the application
                        runs
                        smoothly and securely.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding the .NET Platform</h3>
                    <p>The .NET platform is a software development framework created by Microsoft. It provides a range
                        of
                        tools and services for building and running applications. To understand how the .NET platform
                        works,
                        it's important to explore some of its key components: the Common Language Runtime (CLR), Common
                        Type
                        System (CTS), Common Language Specification (CLS), and Common Intermediate Language (CIL). These
                        elements work together to ensure that applications run smoothly across different languages and
                        platforms. Additionally, the .NET platform supports platform independence, allowing applications
                        to
                        run on various operating systems.</p>

                    <h3>1. Common Language Runtime (CLR)</h3>
                    <p>The CLR is the heart of the .NET platform. It provides a managed environment where .NET
                        applications
                        are executed. The CLR handles essential tasks such as memory management, security, code
                        verification, and exception handling. It also enables different .NET languages to work together
                        seamlessly. When you run a .NET application, the CLR converts Intermediate Language (IL) code
                        into
                        machine code that the specific platform can execute.</p>

                    <h3>2. Common Type System (CTS)</h3>
                    <p>The CTS is a crucial part of the .NET platform that defines a common set of data types that all
                        .NET
                        languages can use. It ensures that these types are consistent and compatible across different
                        languages. By following CTS, developers can create components that work together smoothly,
                        regardless of the language used to create them. The CTS helps in defining how data types are
                        represented
                        and used in memory.</p>

                    <h3>3. Common Language Specification (CLS)</h3>
                    <p>The CLS is a subset of the CTS that outlines a set of rules and guidelines that .NET languages
                        must
                        follow to ensure interoperability. It defines a common set of features that all .NET languages
                        should support. By adhering to CLS, developers can create components that are compatible with
                        any
                        .NET language, making it easier to integrate and use components across different languages.</p>

                    <h3>4. Common Intermediate Language (CIL)</h3>
                    <p>CIL, also known as Intermediate Language (IL), is the intermediate code generated by .NET
                        compilers.
                        It is a platform-independent bytecode that the CLR can understand. When a .NET application is
                        compiled, its source code is transformed into CIL. At runtime, the CLR performs Just-In-Time
                        (JIT)
                        compilation, converting CIL into native machine code specific to the target platform. This
                        allows
                        .NET applications to be decoupled from specific hardware and operating systems.</p>

                    <h3>5. Platform Independence in .NET</h3>
                    <p>Platform independence in .NET means that applications can run on different operating systems and
                        hardware without needing to change the application's code. This is achieved through the use of
                        CIL
                        and the CLR. CIL serves as a platform-independent bytecode, while the CLR performs JIT
                        compilation
                        to convert CIL into machine code for the specific platform. Additionally, cross-platform
                        libraries
                        like ASP.NET Core and Xamarin help developers create applications that run on various platforms,
                        such as Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.</p>

                    <h3>Managed Code and Unmanaged Code</h3>

                    <p>When working with .NET, it's crucial to understand the difference between <strong>managed
                            code</strong> and <strong>unmanaged code</strong>. This distinction plays a big role in how
                        code
                        is executed and how resources are managed within the system.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
                    <p>In .NET, applications often need to handle memory, exceptions, and resources efficiently. Managed
                        code provides a way to let the .NET runtime (CLR) handle these tasks, freeing developers from
                        manual
                        memory management and reducing the risk of common errors. However, not all code runs under the
                        control of the .NET runtime. Some older or low-level code, known as unmanaged code, operates
                        outside
                        the CLR and interacts directly with the operating system. Knowing when and why each type of code
                        is
                        used helps developers work more effectively and securely.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Managed Code</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Managed code is the code that runs under the control of the <strong>Common Language Runtime
                                (CLR)</strong>, the core runtime of the .NET framework.</li>
                        <li>Code written in languages like C# and VB.NET is automatically managed by the CLR. This means
                            that the runtime handles critical services like:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Garbage collection</strong>: Automatically frees up memory by removing
                                    unused
                                    objects.</li>
                                <li><strong>Exception handling</strong>: Ensures that errors are handled safely and
                                    consistently.</li>
                                <li><strong>Type safety</strong>: Prevents the use of incompatible data types, ensuring
                                    more
                                    stable and predictable code.</li>
                                <li><strong>Security enforcement</strong>: Manages access to system resources, ensuring
                                    that
                                    the code cannot perform unauthorized actions.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>One of the advantages of managed code is that developers don’t have to worry about low-level
                            tasks like memory management or system-level errors. The CLR takes care of these
                            automatically.
                        </li>
                        <li>Examples of managed code: C#.NET, VB.NET.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4><strong>Unmanaged Code</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unmanaged code runs directly on the operating system without the supervision of the CLR.
                        </li>
                        <li>This code is usually written in languages like C or C++, where the developer has to handle
                            memory management, errors, and system-level tasks manually.</li>
                        <li>Unmanaged code is compiled directly to machine code, making it faster in some cases, but
                            also
                            more error-prone because there is no runtime safety net (like garbage collection or type
                            safety).</li>
                        <li>Since unmanaged code interacts directly with the operating system, it is more
                            platform-dependent
                            and must be recompiled for different system architectures.</li>
                        <li>Examples of unmanaged code: C, C++.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4><strong>Why Use Both Managed and Unmanaged Code?</strong></h4>
                    <p>In modern applications, it is common to use both managed and unmanaged code together. For
                        example,
                        you may write most of your application in managed C#, but use unmanaged C++ for
                        performance-critical
                        components. .NET provides ways to <strong>interop</strong> with unmanaged code using techniques
                        like
                        P/Invoke (Platform Invocation Services), allowing managed code to call unmanaged functions when
                        necessary.</p>

                    <h3>How CLR and BCL Work Together</h3>
                    <p>CLR aur BCL ek saath kaam karte hain taaki .NET applications ke liye ek efficient execution
                        environment provide ho:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Jab ek .NET application compile hoti hai, IL code BCL ke classes ko reference karta hai. BCL
                            wo
                            sabhi basic functionality provide karta hai jo standard operations ke liye zaroori hoti hai,
                            jaise file handling, data manipulation, aur bhi bahut kuch.</li>
                        <li>CLR runtime par is IL code ko leta hai aur application ko jo BCL components chahiye, unhe
                            load
                            karta hai. Jaise, agar aapka code `List` use karta hai, toh CLR BCL se `List` class ko load
                            karega.</li>
                        <li>CLR memory allocation aur garbage collection ko manage karta hai un objects ke liye jo BCL
                            types
                            ka use karke banaye gaye hote hain. Isse memory ka efficient management hota hai.</li>
                        <li>CLR security aur type safety bhi enforce karta hai jab application BCL components ke saath
                            interact karti hai. Isse unsafe memory access ya unauthorized operations prevent hote hain.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Summary yeh hai ki BCL application development ke liye zaroori libraries provide karta hai, jabki
                        CLR
                        runtime execution, memory management, aur security handle karta hai, jisse application smoothly
                        aur
                        securely chalti hai.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding the .NET Platform</h3>
                    <p>.NET platform ek software development framework hai jo Microsoft ne banaya hai. Ye developers ko
                        tools aur services provide karta hai jo applications banane aur chalane ke kaam aate hain. .NET
                        platform ko samajhne ke liye iske kuch key components ko explore karna zaroori hai: Common
                        Language
                        Runtime (CLR), Common Type System (CTS), Common Language Specification (CLS), aur Common
                        Intermediate Language (CIL). Ye sab milkar ensure karte hain ki applications smooth tarike se
                        chal
                        sakein across different languages aur platforms. Saath hi, .NET platform platform independence
                        support karta hai, jisse applications multiple operating systems par run kar sakti hain.</p>

                    <h3>1. Common Language Runtime (CLR)</h3>
                    <p>CLR .NET platform ka heart hai. Ye ek managed environment provide karta hai jahan .NET
                        applications
                        execute hoti hain. CLR important tasks handle karta hai jaise memory management, security, code
                        verification, aur exception handling. Iske alawa, ye alag-alag .NET languages ko ek saath
                        seamlessly
                        kaam karne deta hai. Jab aap ek .NET application run karte ho, CLR Intermediate Language (IL)
                        code
                        ko machine code me convert karta hai jo specific platform execute kar sakta hai.</p>

                    <h3>2. Common Type System (CTS)</h3>
                    <p>CTS .NET platform ka ek crucial part hai jo ek common set of data types define karta hai jo sabhi
                        .NET languages use kar sakti hain. Ye ensure karta hai ki ye types consistent aur compatible ho
                        across different languages. CTS ko follow karke developers aise components bana sakte hain jo
                        smoothly kaam karein, chahe wo kisi bhi language me likhe gaye ho. CTS ye define karta hai ki
                        data
                        types
                        memory me kaise represent aur use hote hain.</p>

                    <h3>3. Common Language Specification (CLS)</h3>
                    <p>CLS CTS ka ek subset hai jo rules aur guidelines ka set provide karta hai jo .NET languages ko
                        follow
                        karna hota hai taaki interoperability ensure ho. Ye ek common set of features define karta hai
                        jo
                        sabhi .NET languages ko support karna zaroori hai. CLS ko follow karke developers aise
                        components
                        bana
                        sakte hain jo kisi bhi .NET language ke saath compatible ho, isse different languages ke
                        components
                        ko integrate karna aur use karna easy ho jata hai.</p>

                    <h3>4. Common Intermediate Language (CIL)</h3>
                    <p>CIL, jo Intermediate Language (IL) ke naam se bhi jana jata hai, ek intermediate code hai jo .NET
                        compilers generate karte hain. Ye ek platform-independent bytecode hai jo CLR samajh sakta hai.
                        Jab
                        ek .NET application compile hoti hai, uska source code CIL me transform hota hai. Runtime par,
                        CLR
                        Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation perform karta hai, jo CIL ko target platform-specific native
                        machine
                        code me convert karta hai. Isse .NET applications specific hardware aur operating systems se
                        decouple ho jati hain.</p>

                    <h3>5. Platform Independence in .NET</h3>
                    <p>Platform independence ka matlab hai ki .NET applications different operating systems aur hardware
                        par
                        bina code change kiye chal sakti hain. Ye CIL aur CLR ka use karke achieve hota hai. CIL ek
                        platform-independent bytecode ke roop me kaam karta hai, aur CLR JIT compilation perform karke
                        CIL
                        ko specific platform ke machine code me convert karta hai. Iske alawa, ASP.NET Core aur Xamarin
                        jaise cross-platform libraries developers ko aise applications banane me madad karte hain jo
                        Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, aur Android jaise multiple platforms par run kar sakein.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="in">
                    <h3>Managed Code and Unmanaged Code</h3>

                    <p>.NET me kaam karte time <strong>managed code</strong> aur <strong>unmanaged code</strong> ke
                        beech ka
                        difference samajhna zaroori hai. Ye distinction code execution aur system me resources ko manage
                        karne me
                        kaafi important role play karta hai.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why this is important?</strong></p>
                    <p>.NET me applications ko memory, exceptions aur resources ko efficiently handle karna padta hai.
                        Managed code ek tarika provide karta hai jahan .NET runtime (CLR) ye tasks handle karta hai,
                        jisse
                        developers ko manual memory management karne ki zarurat nahi hoti aur common errors ka risk bhi
                        kam
                        ho jata hai. Lekin, saara code .NET runtime ke control me nahi chalta. Kuch purana ya low-level
                        code, jo unmanaged code kehlata hai, CLR ke bahar operate karta hai aur directly operating
                        system ke
                        saath interact karta hai. Kab aur kyu dono tarah ke code use karte hain, ye samajhna developers
                        ke
                        liye helpful aur secure hota hai.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Managed Code</strong></h4>

                        <li>Managed code wo code hai jo <strong>Common Language Runtime (CLR)</strong> ke control me
                            chalta
                            hai, jo .NET framework ka core runtime hai.</li>
                        <li>C# aur VB.NET jaise languages me written code CLR ke through automatically manage hota hai.
                            Iska matlab hai ki runtime critical services handle karta hai jaise:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Garbage collection</strong>: Automatically unused objects ko remove karke
                                    memory
                                    free karta hai.</li>
                                <li><strong>Exception handling</strong>: Errors ko safely aur consistently handle karta
                                    hai.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Type safety</strong>: Incompatible data types ka use prevent karta hai, jo
                                    code
                                    ko stable aur predictable banata hai.</li>
                                <li><strong>Security enforcement</strong>: System resources ka access manage karta hai
                                    aur
                                    unauthorized actions ko prevent karta hai.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Managed code ka ek advantage ye hai ki developers ko low-level tasks jaise memory management
                            ya
                            system-level errors ki tension nahi karni padti. CLR inhe automatically handle karta hai.
                        </li>
                        <li>Examples of managed code: C#.NET, VB.NET.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4><strong>Unmanaged Code</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unmanaged code directly operating system par chalta hai bina CLR ke supervision ke.</li>
                        <li>Ye code usually C ya C++ jaise languages me likha jata hai, jahan developer ko memory
                            management, errors aur system-level tasks manually handle karne padte hain.</li>
                        <li>Unmanaged code seedha machine code me convert hota hai, jo ise kabhi-kabhi faster banata
                            hai.
                            Lekin isme zyada error hone ke chance hote hai, kyunki .NET runtime (CLR) ki safety
                            features,
                            jaise memory management (garbage collection) aur data type ki checking (type safety), isme
                            nahi
                            hote.</li>
                        <li>Unmanaged code directly operating system ke saath interact karta hai, is wajah se ye zyada
                            platform-dependent hota hai aur different system architectures ke liye dubara compile karna
                            padta hai.</li>
                        <li>Examples of unmanaged code: C, C++.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4><strong>Managed aur Unmanaged Code dono use karne ka fayda?</strong></h4>
                    <p>Aaj ke modern applications me managed aur unmanaged code dono ka use karna common hai. For
                        example,
                        aap apni application ka zyada part managed C# me likhoge, lekin performance-critical components
                        ke
                        liye unmanaged C++ ka use karoge. .NET unmanaged code ke saath interact karne ke liye
                        <strong>interop</strong> techniques provide karta hai jaise P/Invoke (Platform Invocation
                        Services),
                        jisse managed code jab zarurat ho unmanaged functions ko call kar sakta hai.

                <h2>Understanding the Core: Assemblies (DLL HELL, Metadata, Namespace & Versioning)</h2>
                <p>When building applications in .NET, it's important to understand how assemblies work. Assemblies are
                    the
                    building blocks of .NET applications and contain code, resources, and metadata that define an
                    application. Along with this, there are a few critical issues like the infamous "DLL Hell," which
                    was a
                    major problem before the introduction of the .NET framework. In this section, we’ll explore
                    assemblies
                    in detail, their components, and how .NET handles challenges like versioning, namespaces, and
                    metadata.
                </p>
                <div class="in">
                    <h3>1. What is an Assembly?</h3>
                    <p>.NET me <strong>assembly</strong> ek application ka building block hota hai. Ye ek compiled code
                        library hai jo deployment, versioning aur security ke liye use hoti hai. Isme code (compiled
                        intermediate language ke form me) aur metadata hota hai jo code ko describe karta hai, aur ye
                        .NET
                        architecture ka ek fundamental part hai.</p>

                    <p>Assemblies do forms me hoti hain:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Executable files (.exe)</strong>: Ye standalone chalne wale application files hoti
                            hain.
                            Jab aap .exe file run karte ho, toh wo directly ek application ko execute karta hai. Example
                            ke
                            liye, agar aap ek Windows application bana rahe ho, toh uska output ek .exe file ho sakta
                            hai jo
                            directly run hoti hai.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic Link Libraries (.dll)</strong>: Ye libraries hoti hain jisme code hota hai
                            jo
                            doosri applications ya libraries use kar sakti hain. .dll file ko aap ek reusable code
                            library
                            ke jaise soch sakte ho. Agar aapke program ko kuch specific functions ya resources ki
                            zarurat
                            hai, toh aap .dll file ko include kar sakte ho. Ye code ko modular banata hai aur ek hi code
                            ko
                            multiple applications mein reuse karne mein madad karta hai.
                            <br>Aapne usually dekha hoga jab aap koi game khelte ho aur game run nahi hota, toh error
                            message
                            aata hai, jaise ki "Missing <strong>xyz.dll</strong> file." Iska matlab ye hota hai ki game
                            ko
                            chalane ke liye us particular .dll file ki zarurat hoti hai, jo ya toh game ke folder mein
                            nahi
                            hoti ya missing hoti hai. Jab aap us missing .dll file ko internet se download karte ho aur
                            game
                            ke folder mein daal dete ho, tab game us file ko use karke properly run kar pata hai.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In short, .exe file ek independent application hoti hai, jabki .dll file ek component hai jo
                        doosri
                        applications mein use hota hai. Games me bhi .dll files ki zarurat hoti hai jab wo specific
                        functionality ya features ko use karte hain.</p>

                    <h3>2. DLL Hell Problem</h3>
                    <p>.NET se pehle, developers ko ek common issue face karna padta tha jise <strong>DLL Hell
                            problem</strong> kaha jaata tha. Ye problem tab hoti thi jab different applications same
                        name ke
                        shared libraries (DLL files) ka use karte the, lekin unke versions alag hote the, jisse
                        conflicts
                        hote the.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Socho, aap Application A install karte ho jo <em>DLL_A</em> version 1.0 use karta hai.</li>
                        <li>Phir, aap Application B install karte ho jo <em>DLL_A</em> version 2.0 use karta hai.</li>
                        <li>Ab, dono applications same name ke DLL ko use kar rahe hain, to system purane version (1.0)
                            ko
                            naya version (2.0) se overwrite kar dega.</li>
                        <li>Isse Application A break ho jayega, kyunki wo version 1.0 ke saath kaam karne ke liye design
                            kiya gaya tha, par ab wo version 2.0 ke saath chal raha hai, jo shayad incompatible ho.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Ye conflict jisme DLLs overwrite ho jaati hain aur applications fail ho jaati hain, use
                        <strong>DLL
                            Hell</strong> kaha jaata hai. Isne applications ko maintain karna kaafi mushkil bana diya
                        tha.
                    </p>
                    <div class="in">
                        <h3>How .NET Solves DLL Hell</h3>
                        <p>.NET ke saath, Microsoft ne assemblies aur versioning ko introduce kiya taaki is problem ko
                            solve
                            kiya jaa sake:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Har assembly ko .NET me uske name, version number, culture, aur public key token (signed
                                assemblies ke liye) se uniquely identify kiya jaata hai.</li>
                            <li>Isse same assembly ke different versions ek system pe ek saath coexist kar sakte hain
                                bina
                                ek doosre ko overwrite kiye, jo DLL Hell problem ko eliminate karta hai.</li>
                            <li>Assemblies ko <strong>Global Assembly Cache (GAC)</strong> me store kiya jaata hai, jo
                                ek
                                special location hai machine pe, jahan multiple versions of assemblies ek saath
                                installed ho
                                sakte hain.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Global Assembly Cache (GAC)</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>GAC</strong> ek centralized location hai Windows me jahan .NET assemblies store hoti
                            hain. GAC ki madad se same assembly ke multiple versions ek saath coexist kar sakte hain,
                            jisse
                            different applications ko manage karna aasan ho jaata hai jo alag versions ke DLLs pe depend
                            karte hain.</p>

                <div class="in">
                    <h3>3. Versioning</h3>
                    <p><strong>Versioning</strong> ek technique hai jisme assemblies ko alag-alag versions diye jaate
                        hain,
                        taaki applications correct version of DLL ko load karein, jiske against wo build kiye gaye the.
                        Ye
                        technique especially DLL Hell ko resolve karne ke liye useful hai.</p>
                    <p>Har assembly ka ek version number hota hai jo iss format me hota hai
                        <strong>Major.Minor.Build.Revision</strong>:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Major version</strong>: Software me significant change ya redesign ko indicate karta
                            hai.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minor version</strong>: Naye features ko indicate karta hai, lekin software ab bhi
                            previous major version ke saath compatible hota hai.</li>
                        <li><strong>Build number</strong>: Usually software ke har build ke saath increment hota hai.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Revision</strong>: Minor fixes aur updates ke liye use hota hai, jaise bug fixes ya
                            patches.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Ek assembly version ka example: <code>1.2.345.0</code></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1</strong>: Major version</li>
                        <li><strong>2</strong>: Minor version</li>
                        <li><strong>345</strong>: Build number</li>
                        <li><strong>0</strong>: Revision</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>


                <div class="in">
                    <h3>4. Metadata</h3>
                    <p>Har assembly me .NET ke andar <strong>metadata</strong> hota hai, jo code ke baare me information
                        deta hai. Metadata code ke baare me ye information provide karta hai:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Classes, methods, aur properties ke names aur types.</li>
                        <li>Assembly ka version.</li>
                        <li>Har method ke liye parameters aur return values ke types ke baare me information.</li>
                        <li>Code ke liye required security permissions.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Metadata kaafi important hai kyunki ye assemblies ko apne aap ko describe karne ki ability deta
                        hai,
                        jo features jaise reflection ko enable karta hai. Reflection se programs apne structure ko
                        runtime
                        ke dauran examine aur modify kar sakte hain.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="in">
                    <h3>5. Namespace</h3>
                    <p><strong>Namespace</strong> .NET me related classes, interfaces, enums, aur structs ko organize
                        aur
                        group karne ka ek tareeka hai. Ye naam ke conflicts ko avoid karta hai aur code ko zyada
                        readable
                        aur maintainable banata hai.</p>

                    <p>For example, .NET framework kai namespaces ka use karta hai:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>System</strong>: Ek root namespace hai jo basic classes aur base data types jaise
                            strings, arrays, aur numbers ko contain karta hai.</li>
                        <li><strong>System.IO</strong>: Ek namespace hai jo input aur output operations ke liye classes

                <h2>Understanding the Core: Assemblies (DLL HELL, Metadata, Namespace & Versioning)</h2>
                <p>When building applications in .NET, it's important to understand how assemblies work. Assemblies are
                    the
                    building blocks of .NET applications and contain code, resources, and metadata that define an
                    application. Along with this, there are a few critical issues like the infamous "DLL Hell," which
                    was a
                    major problem before the introduction of the .NET framework. In this section, we’ll explore
                    assemblies
                    in detail, their components, and how .NET handles challenges like versioning, namespaces, and
                    metadata.
                </p>
                <div class="in">
                    <h3>1. What is an Assembly?</h3>
                    <p>An <strong>assembly</strong> in .NET is a building block of an application. It's a compiled code
                        library
                        used for deployment, versioning, and security. It contains both the code (in the form of
                        compiled
                        intermediate language) and the metadata that describes the code, making it a fundamental part of
                        the
                        .NET architecture.</p>

                    <p>Assemblies can be in two forms:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Executable files (.exe)</strong>: These are application files that run standalone.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic Link Libraries (.dll)</strong>: These are libraries that contain code which
                            other
                            applications or libraries can use.</li>
                    </ul>

                </div>
                <div class="in">
                    <h3>2. DLL Hell Problem</h3>
                    <p>Before .NET, developers faced a common issue known as the <strong>DLL Hell problem</strong>. This
                        problem
                        occurred because different applications often used shared libraries (DLL files) with the same
                        name
                        but
                        different versions, leading to conflicts.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Imagine you install Application A that uses <em>DLL_A</em> version 1.0.</li>
                        <li>Then, you install Application B that also uses <em>DLL_A</em> but version 2.0.</li>
                        <li>Since both applications are using a DLL with the same name, the system would overwrite the
                            old
                            version (1.0) with the new one (2.0).</li>
                        <li>This would cause Application A to break because it was designed to work with version 1.0,
                            but
                            now
                            it’s using version 2.0, which might be incompatible.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This conflict where DLLs get overwritten and cause applications to fail is known as <strong>DLL
                            Hell</strong>. It made maintaining applications very difficult.</p>
                    <div class="wh">
                        <h3>How .NET Solves DLL Hell</h3>
                        <p>With .NET, Microsoft introduced assemblies and versioning to solve this problem:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each assembly in .NET is uniquely identified by its name, version number, culture, and
                                public
                                key
                                token (for signed assemblies).</li>
                            <li>This allows different versions of the same assembly to coexist on the system without
                                overwriting
                                each other, eliminating the DLL Hell problem.</li>
                            <li>Assemblies are stored in the <strong>Global Assembly Cache (GAC)</strong>, a special
                                location on
                                the
                                machine that allows multiple versions of assemblies to be installed side by side.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </div>
                    <div class="wh">

                        <p><strong>Global Assembly Cache (GAC)</strong></p>
                        <p>The <strong>GAC</strong> is a centralized location in Windows where .NET assemblies are
                            stored.
                            The GAC
                            allows multiple versions of the same assembly to coexist, making it easier to manage
                            different
                            applications that depend on different versions of a DLL.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>


                <div class="in">
                    <h3>3. Versioning</h3>
                    <p><strong>Versioning</strong> is the technique used to assign different versions to assemblies,
                        ensuring
                        that applications load the correct version of a DLL they were built against. This is especially
                        useful
                        for resolving DLL Hell.</p>

                    <p>Each assembly has a version number in the format <strong>Major.Minor.Build.Revision</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Major version</strong>: Indicates a significant change or redesign in the software.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Minor version</strong>: Indicates new features, but the software is still compatible
                            with
                            the previous major version.</li>
                        <li><strong>Build number</strong>: Usually incremented with every build of the software.</li>
                        <li><strong>Revision</strong>: Used for minor fixes and updates, like bug fixes or patches.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Example of an assembly version: <code>1.2.345.0</code></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1</strong>: Major version</li>
                        <li><strong>2</strong>: Minor version</li>
                        <li><strong>345</strong>: Build number</li>
                        <li><strong>0</strong>: Revision</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>


                <div class="in">
                    <h3>4. Metadata</h3>
                    <p>Every assembly in .NET contains <strong>metadata</strong>, which is data about the code itself.
                        Metadata
                        provides the following information about the code:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The names and types of classes, methods, and properties.</li>
                        <li>The version of the assembly.</li>
                        <li>Information about the types of parameters and return values for each method.</li>
                        <li>Security permissions required by the code.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Metadata is crucial because it allows assemblies to describe themselves, enabling features like
                        reflection, which lets programs examine and modify their own structure during runtime.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="in">
                    <h3>5. Namespace</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>namespace</strong> is a way of organizing and grouping related classes, interfaces,
                        enums,
                        and
                        structs in .NET. It helps avoid name conflicts and makes the code more readable and
                        maintainable.
                    </p>

                    <p>For example, the .NET framework uses a variety of namespaces:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>System</strong>: A root namespace that contains basic classes and base data types
                            like
                            strings,
                            arrays, and numbers.</li>
                        <li><strong>System.IO</strong>: A namespace that contains classes for input and output
                            operations,
                            such
                            as
                            reading from and writing to files.</li>
                        <li><strong>System.Net</strong>: Contains classes for networking tasks, like sending requests
                            over
                            HTTP.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>When using classes from a namespace, you can refer to the full name (namespace + class), like
                        this:
                    </p>

                    <pre>
                        <code>
using System;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>In the example above, <strong>System</strong> is the namespace, and <strong>Console</strong> is
                        the
                        class. The
                        <strong>using System;</strong> statement allows you to refer to the class directly by name,
                        without
                        needing
                        to type <strong>System.Console</strong> every time.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="in">
                    <h3>6. Assemblies and Namespace Together</h3>
                    <p>Namespaces help organize code within assemblies. A single assembly can contain multiple
                        namespaces,
                        and
                        namespaces can span across multiple assemblies. This allows developers to structure their code
                        in a
                        clean, logical way that is easy to maintain.</p>
