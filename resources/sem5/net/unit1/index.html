            <h3>The Problem Before .NET</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Before .NET, developers faced many challenges when building software. They had to deal with:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Writing different code for different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
                        <li>Using different programming languages with no easy way to make them work together.</li>
                        <li>Managing DLL Hell, a problem where different applications required different versions of the same shared libraries, leading to conflicts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Solution: Why Did Microsoft Create .NET?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Microsoft wanted to create a platform that could solve these issues by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allowing code to run on multiple platforms (not just Windows).</li>
                        <li>Supporting multiple programming languages in a single environment.</li>
                        <li>Simplifying how applications are developed, deployed, and maintained.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the year <strong>2000</strong>, Microsoft introduced the .NET Framework.</p>
        
            <div class="in">
                <h3>What is .NET?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>.NET is a software framework, which is a collection of tools and libraries that help developers build different types of applications (like desktop apps, web apps, and mobile apps).</li>
                    <li>A framework is a collection of technologies integrated together to develop applications that can be executed anywhere.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        
            <div class="in">
                <h3>The Evolution of .NET</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initially, the .NET Framework was designed for Windows-only applications. It included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A runtime called Common Language Runtime (CLR), which ensured the applications could run efficiently.</li>
                            <li>A large set of libraries to help with tasks like connecting to databases and handling files.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Shift to .NET Core (2016):
                        <ul>
                            <li>As technology advanced, developers needed a framework that could work on more than just Windows. Microsoft introduced .NET Core in 2016.</li>
                            <li>.NET Core was cross-platform, meaning you could use it to build apps for Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Unified .NET (2020 onwards):
                        <ul>
                            <li>In 2020, Microsoft released .NET 5, a unified version of .NET that merged the best features of both the .NET Framework and .NET Core.</li>
                            <li>Now, developers just refer to it as .NET, which works on all platforms.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Components Provided by .NET</h3>
                <p>The .NET framework provides two main components:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>BCL (Base Class Library)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>CLR (Common Language Runtime)</strong></li>
                </ol>
        
                <h3>BCL (Base Class Library)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Base Class Library is designed by Microsoft. Without the BCL, we cannot write any code in the .NET framework. It is also known as the building blocks of .NET programs.</li>
                    <li>The BCL contains predefined classes that are used for application development. These are installed on machines when the .NET framework is installed.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>CLR (Common Language Runtime)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>CLR is the core component under the .NET framework responsible for converting MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) code into native code, which can then be executed by the operating system.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <img src="../../images/net1.jpeg" alt="">
                <ul>
                    <li>In the .NET framework, the code is compiled twice:
                        <ol>
                            <li>First, the source code is compiled by the respective language compiler, which generates intermediate code known as MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) or IL (Intermediate Language) or Managed Code.</li>
                            <li>Then, MSIL is converted into native code (code specific to the operating system) using the CLR.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Programming Languages Supported by .NET</h3>
                <p>.NET supports more than 70 programming languages, 9 of which are designed by Microsoft, while the remaining are designed by other vendors.</p>
            
                <h3>Languages Designed by Microsoft</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>VB.NET (Visual Basic .NET)</strong> – A high-level programming language that is simple and easy to use, often preferred for developing Windows applications with a graphical user interface.</li>
                    <li><strong>C#.NET (C#)</strong> – A powerful, object-oriented language, widely used for enterprise applications. It combines the ease of Visual Basic with the power of C++ and is the most popular .NET language.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual C++ .NET</strong> – A version of C++ designed for the .NET platform, offering both object-oriented and low-level programming capabilities, primarily for performance-sensitive applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>F#.NET</strong> – A functional-first programming language, known for its concise syntax and strong support for parallel programming. It’s great for mathematical computations, data analysis, and financial modeling.</li>
                    <li><strong>JScript.NET</strong> – A version of JavaScript optimized for server-side programming and integration with the .NET framework. It is rarely used in modern applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>J#.NET (JSharp)</strong> – A language that was designed to help Java developers transition to the .NET framework. It allows developers to use Java syntax while utilizing .NET's capabilities, but it has been deprecated.</li>
                    <li><strong>PowerShell</strong> – A task automation and configuration management framework, built on .NET. It’s mostly used for automating tasks in IT environments and managing systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>IronPython</strong> – A version of Python that is integrated with the .NET framework. It allows Python developers to take advantage of the .NET libraries and runtime.</li>
                    <li><strong>IronRuby</strong> – A version of the Ruby programming language that runs on the .NET framework. Like IronPython, it allows Ruby developers to integrate with .NET libraries and components.</li>
