                <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid in a Cover Letter</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Generic Content:</strong> Avoid using a one-size-fits-all cover letter. Tailor it to the

                    <li><strong>Spelling and Grammar Errors:</strong> Always proofread your cover letter for mistakes
                        before sending it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Too Lengthy:</strong> Keep your cover letter concise, ideally no longer than one page.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Unfocused: </strong> Focus on relevant skills and experiences that align with the job
                        you're applying for.</li>
