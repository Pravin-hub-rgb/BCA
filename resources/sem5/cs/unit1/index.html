            <div class="in">
                <h3>What is Subject-Verb Agreement?</h3>
                <p>In English, the verb must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural) and person (first,
                    second, third). This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A singular subject takes a singular verb.</li>
                    <li>A plural subject takes a plural verb.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Singular and Plural Verb Forms:</h3>
                <p>For most verbs in the present tense:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Singular verbs often have an "s" or "es" added to the base form of the verb.
                        <p>Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Runs, Watches, Flies, Barks & Studies</strong>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Plural verbs do not have this "s" or "es."
                        <p>Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Run, Watch, Fly, Bark & Study.</strong>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Has</strong> and <strong>Have</strong> as verbs:
                        <p>"Has" is used with singular subjects, and "Have" is used with plural subjects and the
                            pronouns I and you.</p>
                        <p>Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Is</strong> and <strong>Are</strong> as verbs:
                        <p>Both <strong>"is"</strong> and <strong>"are"</strong> are forms of the verb <strong>"to
                                be"</strong> and are used for subject-verb agreement based on the subject's number
                            (singular or plural).</p>

                            <li>Incorrect: "The team <strong>win</strong> the game." (The verb "win" is plural and
                                doesn’t match the singular collective noun "team.")</li>
                            <li>"The family <strong>lives</strong> in that house." (The collective noun "family" is
                                singular, so the verb "lives" is singular.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The family <strong>live</strong> in that house." (The verb "live" is plural

                            <li>However, in some cases (especially British English), a plural verb can be used when
                                emphasizing the individuals in the group.

                                is singular, so the verb "has" is singular.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The jury <strong>have</strong> reached a verdict." (The verb "have" is

                            The verb "to be" has three forms in the present tense:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>"am"</strong> is used with the subject "<strong>I</strong>."</li>
                            <li><strong>"is"</strong> is used with singular subjects like "<strong>he</strong>,"
                                "<strong>she</strong>," or "<strong>it</strong>."</li>
                            <li><strong>"are"</strong> is used with plural subjects like "<strong>we</strong>,"
                                "<strong>you</strong>," or "<strong>they</strong>."</li>
                        </ul>
                        In sentences, the verb "to be" must agree with the subject's number and person:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"I <strong>am</strong> happy." (Correct use of "am" with the subject "I.")</li>
                            <li>"He <strong>is</strong> tired." (Correct use of "is" with the singular subject "he.")
                            </li>
                            <li>"They <strong>are</strong> excited." (Correct use of "are" with the plural subject
                                "they.")</li>
                        </ul>
                        Incorrect forms occur when the wrong version of the verb "to be" is used:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"I <strong>is</strong> happy." (Incorrect, should be "am.")</li>
                            <li>"He <strong>am</strong> tired." (Incorrect, should be "is.")</li>
                            <li>"They <strong>is</strong> excited." (Incorrect, should be "are.")</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <strong>Titles, names, and singular entities → Singular verb:</strong> Titles of books, movies,
                        or organizations, even if they sound plural, are singular.
                        <p>Example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"The United Nations <strong>is</strong> meeting today." (Although "United Nations"
                                refers to a group, it is treated as a singular entity, so the verb "is" is used.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The United Nations <strong>are</strong> meeting today." ("Are" is plural and
                                doesn't match the singular subject "United Nations.")</li>
                            <li>"Harry Potter <strong>is</strong> a popular book." (The title "Harry Potter" is
                                singular, so the verb "is" is used.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "Harry Potter <strong>are</strong> a popular book." ("Are" is plural and
                                doesn't match the singular title "Harry Potter.")</li>
                            <li>"The Avengers <strong>is</strong> an exciting movie." (Despite "Avengers" sounding
                                plural, it is considered a singular entity in this case, so "is" is used.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The Avengers <strong>are</strong> an exciting movie." (Even though
                                "Avengers" sounds plural, the title is treated as a singular noun.)</li>
                            <li>"The Lord of the Rings <strong>is</strong> a classic trilogy." (The title "The Lord of
                                the Rings" refers to a singular work, so the verb "is" is used.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The Lord of the Rings <strong>are</strong> a classic trilogy." (The title is
                                singular, so "are" does not match.)</li>
                            <li>"National Geographic <strong>is</strong> a popular magazine." (The name of the magazine
                                is singular, so the verb "is" is used.)</li>
                            <li>"The Mona Lisa <strong>is</strong> famous." (The title of the painting is treated as
                                singular, so "is" is used.)</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        <strong>When the subject and verb are separated:</strong> The verb should still agree with the
                        main subject.
                        <p>Example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"The bouquet of flowers <strong>is</strong> beautiful." (The subject "bouquet" is
                                singular, so the verb "is" is singular, even though "flowers" is plural and separated
                                from the subject.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The bouquet of flowers <strong>are</strong> beautiful." ("Bouquet" is
                                singular, so the verb must be singular, despite the plural noun "flowers.")</li>
                            <li>"The team of players <strong>is</strong> winning the match." (The subject "team" is
                                singular, so the verb "is" is singular, even though "players" is plural and appears
                                closer to the verb.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The team of players <strong>are</strong> winning the match." ("Team" is
                                singular, so the verb "are" is incorrect in this context.)</li>
                            <li>"The teacher with the students <strong>is</strong> at the door." (The subject "teacher"
                                is singular, so the verb "is" is singular, even though "students" is plural.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The teacher with the students <strong>are</strong> at the door." ("Teacher"
                                is singular, so the verb should be singular.)</li>
                            <li>"The box of chocolates <strong>is</strong> on the table." (The subject "box" is
                                singular, so the verb "is" is singular, even though "chocolates" is plural.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The box of chocolates <strong>are</strong> on the table." ("Box" is
                                singular, so the verb must be singular.)</li>

                            <li>"There <strong>are</strong> books on the table." (Plural noun "books," so the verb "are"
                                is plural.)</li>
                            <li>"There <strong>is</strong> a cat under the chair." (Singular noun "cat," so the verb

                            <li>"There <strong>is</strong> a person waiting outside." (Singular noun "person," so the

                            <li>"There <strong>are</strong> two issues to resolve." (Plural noun "issues," so the verb

                            tense emphasizes the duration of an action that started in the past and is still ongoing
                            (e.g., She has been working at the company for 10 years, I have been learning English for

                                    Continuous focuses on actions that started in the past and are still ongoing (e.g.,

                                    five years).</li>
                                <li>Be careful not to use stative verbs (e.g., know, love, believe) in the Present
                                    Perfect Continuous (e.g., Incorrect: I have been knowing him for a long time.

                                <li>Don’t use the Past Continuous for actions that are habitual or repeated (e.g.,

                        <li><strong>Use for actions completed before another event in the past:</strong> The Past
                            Perfect emphasizes the completion of one action before another past event. For example, "I

                        <li><strong>Use with Past Simple to show sequence of events:</strong> The Past Perfect is often
                            used together with the Simple Past to show the order of events. The Past Perfect shows the
                            action that happened first, and the Simple Past shows the action that happened later (e.g.,
                            She had finished her meal when I arrived).</li>

                        <li><strong>Interrogative form:</strong> Had + subject + Past Participle? (e.g., Had you eaten

                                <li>Don’t confuse the Past Perfect with the Simple Past. The Past Perfect is used to
                                    show that an action was completed before another past event, while the Simple Past
                                    describes a completed action with no reference to a specific time (e.g., Incorrect:
                                    I finished my homework before the movie started. Correct: I had finished my homework

                                <li>Be careful when using the Past Perfect with time expressions. For example, "before"
                                    and "after" can sometimes lead to confusion, as the Past Perfect action happens
                                    before another past action (e.g., Incorrect: I had never visited the park last year.

                        <li><strong>Use for actions in progress before another action in the past:</strong> The Past
                            Perfect Continuous emphasizes the ongoing nature of an action that was happening before
                            another action took place in the past. For example, "I had been studying for two hours
                            before dinner" highlights that the studying continued for a certain duration before dinner.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Use to emphasize the duration of an action:</strong> The Past Perfect Continuous
                            often emphasizes how long something had been happening before something else occurred (e.g.,
                            "They had been waiting for the bus for an hour when it finally arrived").</li>
                        <li><strong>Negative form:</strong> Subject + had not been + Verb(-ing) (e.g., I had not been
                            sleeping when you called, She had not been working all day).</li>
                        <li><strong>Interrogative form:</strong> Had + subject + been + Verb(-ing)? (e.g., Had you been

                                <li>Don't confuse the Past Perfect Continuous with the Past Continuous. The Past Perfect
                                    Continuous is used to emphasize the duration of an action that was happening before
                                    another event in the past, while the Past Continuous focuses on actions happening at
                                    a specific time in the past (e.g., Incorrect: I was studying for two hours before
                                    dinner. Correct: I had been studying for two hours before dinner).</li>
                                <li>Be cautious with time expressions like "for" and "since" — "for" indicates a period
                                    of time (e.g., "I had been waiting for an hour"), while "since" indicates a specific
                                    starting point (e.g., "I had been waiting since 3 p.m.").</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>In English, the future tense primarily focuses on two forms because they cover the most
                            practical and commonly used scenarios:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Simple Future:</strong> Used for decisions, promises, or events that will take
                                place.
                                <br>Example: "I will call you tomorrow."
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Future Continuous:</strong> Emphasizes ongoing actions at a specific time in the
                                future.
                                <br>Example: "I will be traveling at this time next week."

                            frequently
                            used in daily communication and are often replaced by simpler alternatives or contextual

                    and execute certain code based on whether the condition is true or false.

                <p>The Zero Conditional is used to talk about general truths, facts, or situations that are always true
                    when something happens. It describes cause and effect, where the result is always true if the
                    condition is met. This conditional is used to express scientific facts, rules, laws of nature, and
                    everyday truths.</p>

                            <li>Using different tenses: Remember, the Zero Conditional always uses the Present Simple
                                tense in both clauses (e.g., "If you heat water, it will boil" is incorrect). The
                                correct version is "If you heat water, it boils."</li>
                            <li>Using modals: The Zero Conditional is about certainty, so avoid using modals like "can,"
                                "may," or "might" in this structure (e.g., "If you press the button, it can turn on" is
                                incorrect). Instead, use "it turns on."</li>

                    The focus is on the doer of the action, which is the subject. This is the

                                    Explanation: The focus shifts to "<strong>the man</strong>"
                                    as the receiver of the
                                    action "<strong>was bitten</strong>."

                                    and is less important in

                                    Explanation: The focus is on "<strong>the cake</strong>" and
                                    the action "<strong>was
                                        eaten</strong>."
                                    The doer of the action is not specified, as it is either
                                    unknown or irrelevant.

                                    Explanation: In formal writing, the focus is on the action
                                    "<strong>was
                                        conducted</strong>" and its purpose, rather than who

                                <li>
                                    Explanation: The focus is on the result "<strong>were
                                        found</strong>" rather than
                                    who found them.
                                    This makes the sentence objective and result-oriented.

                <h3>Common Mistakes:</h3>
                <p>Some common mistakes when using passive voice:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Incorrect: "The letter is wrote by him."</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Explanation: The verb "<strong>wrote</strong>" is the past form,
                                not the past
                                participle. In passive voice, the main verb must be in its past
                                participle form.
                            </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Explanation: The verb "<strong>reading</strong>" is in the
                                present participle form,
                                which is incorrect in passive voice. The past participle
                                "<strong>read</strong>" should
                                be used instead.

                            <li>
                                Explanation: The verb "<strong>complete</strong>" is in the base
                                form. In passive voice,
                                the past participle "<strong>completed</strong>" should be used.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Explanation: The pronoun "<strong>we</strong>" is incorrectly
                                used in the object form.
                                The correct object pronoun is "<strong>us</strong>."

                                Explanation: The verb "<strong>make</strong>" is in the base
                                form. In passive voice, the
                                past participle "<strong>made</strong>" should be used.

                <h3>Tricks to Identify Active and Passive Voice:</h3>
                <p>Use these simple tricks to quickly determine whether a sentence is in active
                    or passive voice:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trick 1: Look for the subject performing the action.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the subject is performing the action, the sentence is in the

                                                "<strong>chased</strong>." Hence, it is active.

                                            <li>The subject "<strong>ball</strong>" receives the

                                            <li>The verb "<strong>is baked</strong>" indicates
                                                passive voice because
                                                "<strong>is</strong>" is a form of "to be."</li>

                        <strong>Trick 4: Replace the verb with a simple form like

                        <ul>
                            <li>If "eat" fits into the sentence structure as "<strong>is

                                                eaten by the chef" (fits well, so it's passive).

                        <ul>
                            <li>In passive voice, the object of the active sentence becomes the

                                            <li>The object "<strong>a book</strong>" remains an
                                                object, so it's active.

            <h2>Indianism: Commonly Used Words and Phrases to Be Avoided in Formal Language</h2>
            <p>Indianism refers to words, phrases, or sentence structures influenced by regional
                languages in India that
                deviate from standard formal English usage. These are common in casual
                conversations but should be
                avoided in professional or academic contexts.</p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Common Examples of Indianisms:</h3>
                <p>Here are some phrases or usages that are often considered incorrect or
                    informal:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Use of "revert back"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Please revert back to me.</li>
                            <li>Correct: Please revert to me.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Revert" already means "to respond," so "back" is
                                redundant.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "prepone"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Let's prepone the meeting.</li>
                            <li>Correct: Let's move the meeting earlier/forward.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Prepone" is not standard English. You should say
                                "move the meeting
                                earlier" or "reschedule."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "passing out"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: He passed out from college last year.</li>
                            <li>Correct: He graduated from college last year.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: In English, "pass out" means to faint, while
                                "graduate" refers to
                                completing a course of study.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "only" for emphasis</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: I will do it like this only.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I will do it like this.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: Adding "only" in this context is unnecessary and
                                incorrect.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "out of station"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: I am out of station for a week.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I am out of town for a week.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Out of station" is a literal translation from
                                Indian languages; "out of
                                town" is the proper English phrase.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>"Discuss about"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Let’s discuss about the project.</li>
                            <li>Correct: Let’s discuss the project.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Discuss" already means to talk about something, so
                                "about" is redundant.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>"Do the needful"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Please do the needful.</li>
                            <li>Correct: Please take the necessary action.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Do the needful" is an outdated phrase; it's
                                clearer to say "take the
                                necessary action" or "please address this."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Using "redundant" expressions like "with regards to"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: With regards to your email.</li>
                            <li>Correct: Regarding your email.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Regarding" is more concise and correct.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "pass out" for alcohol consumption</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: He passed out after drinking too much alcohol.</li>
                            <li>Correct: He blacked out after drinking too much alcohol.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Passed out" usually means fainting or losing
                                consciousness, but when
                                referring to the effects of alcohol, "blacked out" is more
                                accurate.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "kindly" excessively</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Kindly let me know if you are available.</li>
                            <li>Correct: Please let me know if you are available.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Kindly" can sound overly formal or old-fashioned.
                                "Please" is more
                                commonly used in modern English.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "backside" for location</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: The park is at the backside of the house.</li>
                            <li>Correct: The park is behind the house.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Backside" refers to a person's rear. For location,
                                use "behind."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "order for" instead of "order"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: I would like to order for a coffee.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I would like to order a coffee.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Order" doesn’t need "for"; it’s already implied.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Use of "today morning" or "yesterday night"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: I saw him today morning.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I saw him this morning.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "This morning" is the correct phrase. Similarly, it
                                should be "last night,"
                                not "yesterday night."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Use of "cousin brother" or "cousin sister"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: My cousin brother lives in Delhi.</li>
                            <li>Correct: My cousin lives in Delhi.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: In English, "cousin" already implies a relative, so
                                adding "brother" or
                                "sister" is unnecessary.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Use of "off the light"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Please off the light.</li>
                            <li>Correct: Please turn off the light.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Off" isn’t a verb. You should use "turn off" when
                                referring to lights or
                                appliances.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Use of "years back"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: He moved here 5 years ago.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Ago" is the correct word for expressing past time,
                                not "back."</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Use of "order for a meal"</strong>

                            <li>Explanation: The phrase "for" is redundant here.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Use of "myself" as the subject</strong>

                            <li>Incorrect: Myself John, and I’m calling from ABC company.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I am John, and I’m calling from ABC company.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Myself" is a reflexive pronoun and should not be
                                used as the subject of a
                                sentence. Use "I am" or just "I."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Use of "one of my friend"</strong>

                            <li>Incorrect: One of my friend is coming tomorrow.</li>
                            <li>Correct: One of my friends is coming tomorrow.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: After "one of," use the plural form of the noun
                                (friends) because you’re
                                referring to one person from a group.</li>

                            <li>Correct: What is your name?</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Good name" is an Indianism. In English, you simply
                                ask for someone's name.
                            </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "too much" instead of "very"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: She is very beautiful.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Too much" implies excess in a negative sense,
                                while "very" is used for
                                emphasis in a positive sense.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Using "by-hearted" instead of "memorized"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: I memorized the poem.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "By-hearted" is not correct English. "Memorized" is
                                the right term when you
                                learn something by memory.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Correct: I’ll do it as you wish.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "As you wish" is the proper idiomatic expression.
                                "As per your wish" is
                                overly formal and awkward.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Using "put a mail" instead of "send an email"</strong>

                            <li>Incorrect: I’ll put a mail to him.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I’ll send him an email.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: You "send" emails, not "put" them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "reply back" instead of "reply"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: Please reply to me soon.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Reply" already means to respond, so "back" is
                                unnecessary.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Using "open the TV" instead of "turn on the TV"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Can you open the TV?</li>
                            <li>Correct: Can you turn on the TV?</li>
                            <li>Explanation: You "turn on" electronic devices, not "open" them.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "I am having" for possession</strong>

                            <li>Correct: I have a car.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Having" is used for ongoing actions, while "have"
                                is used to show
                                possession.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "do mistake" instead of "make a mistake"</strong>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Explanation: You "make" a mistake, not "do" one.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "big big" or "small small" for emphasis</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: I saw big big houses there.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I saw very big houses there.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: Repeating adjectives like "big big" is an
                                Indianism. Instead, use "very" or
                                another qualifier.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Using "donate blood" when offering help</strong>

                            <li>Correct: I will give blood.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Donate" is used when you give something
                                permanently, while "give" is the
                                correct verb in this medical context.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Correct: Please hang up the phone after talking.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Hang up" is the proper term for ending a phone
                                call.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Explanation: The correct expression is "not in the syllabus" or
                                "outside the syllabus."

                            <li>Explanation: "Time pass" is an Indianism; the correct phrase in
                                English is "passing
                                time" or "killing time."</li>

                            <li>Explanation: "Cent percent" is an Indianism, while "100 percent"
                                is the correct form.

                            <li>Explanation: "Upgradation" is not standard English. Use

                            <li>Explanation: "Good self" is an overly formal expression and
                                unnecessary. Simply use
                                "you."</li>

                                both people.)</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Same to you" is only used when the same greeting
                                or wish applies to both
                                people (e.g., "Happy New Year"). For unique situations, just

                            <li>Explanation: "Loose" means not tight, while "lose" refers to

                            <li>Explanation: "Furniture" is an uncountable noun, so it doesn't

                            <li>Explanation: "Years old" is the correct term for age, not "years
                                completed."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "shifted" instead of "moved"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: We shifted to a new house last week.</li>
                            <li>Correct: We moved to a new house last week.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Shifted" refers to changing position or adjusting
                                something, while "moved"
                                is the correct verb for relocating to a new place.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "on tomorrow" instead of "tomorrow"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: I will meet you on tomorrow.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I will meet you tomorrow.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Tomorrow" doesn't require the preposition "on." It
                                stands alone.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "each and every" together</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: I checked each and every item.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I checked every item.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Each" and "every" both imply completeness, so
                                using them together is
                                redundant. Choose one or the other.</li>
                        </ul>
