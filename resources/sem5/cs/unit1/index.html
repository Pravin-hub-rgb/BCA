                <h3>What is Subject-Verb Agreement?</h3>
                <p>In English, the verb must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural) and person (first,
                    second, third). This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A singular subject takes a singular verb.</li>
                    <li>A plural subject takes a plural verb.</li>
                </ul>

                        <strong>Collective nouns (group, team, family) → Singular verb:</strong> Collective nouns, which

                            <li>"The team <strong>wins</strong> the game." (The collective noun "team" is singular, so

                            <li>Incorrect: "The team <strong>win</strong> the game." (The verb "win" is plural and

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong>
                            The verb "to be" has three forms in the present tense:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>"am"</strong> is used with the subject "<strong>I</strong>."</li>
                            <li><strong>"is"</strong> is used with singular subjects like "<strong>he</strong>,"
                                "<strong>she</strong>," or "<strong>it</strong>."</li>
                            <li><strong>"are"</strong> is used with plural subjects like "<strong>we</strong>,"
                                "<strong>you</strong>," or "<strong>they</strong>."</li>
                        </ul>
                        In sentences, the verb "to be" must agree with the subject's number and person:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"I <strong>am</strong> happy." (Correct use of "am" with the subject "I.")</li>
                            <li>"He <strong>is</strong> tired." (Correct use of "is" with the singular subject "he.")
                            </li>
                            <li>"They <strong>are</strong> excited." (Correct use of "are" with the plural subject
                                "they.")</li>
                        </ul>
                        Incorrect forms occur when the wrong version of the verb "to be" is used:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"I <strong>is</strong> happy." (Incorrect, should be "am.")</li>
                            <li>"He <strong>am</strong> tired." (Incorrect, should be "is.")</li>
                            <li>"They <strong>is</strong> excited." (Incorrect, should be "are.")</li>

                        <strong>Titles, names, and singular entities → Singular verb:</strong> Titles of books, movies,
                        or organizations, even if they sound plural, are singular.

                            <li>"The United Nations <strong>is</strong> meeting today." (Although "United Nations"
                                refers to a group, it is treated as a singular entity, so the verb "is" is used.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The United Nations <strong>are</strong> meeting today." ("Are" is plural and

                            <li>"Harry Potter <strong>is</strong> a popular book." (The title "Harry Potter" is

                            <li>"The Avengers <strong>is</strong> an exciting movie." (Despite "Avengers" sounding
                                plural, it is considered a singular entity in this case, so "is" is used.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The Avengers <strong>are</strong> an exciting movie." (Even though
                                "Avengers" sounds plural, the title is treated as a singular noun.)</li>
                            <li>"The Lord of the Rings <strong>is</strong> a classic trilogy." (The title "The Lord of
                                the Rings" refers to a singular work, so the verb "is" is used.)</li>
                            <li>Incorrect: "The Lord of the Rings <strong>are</strong> a classic trilogy." (The title is
                                singular, so "are" does not match.)</li>
                            <li>"National Geographic <strong>is</strong> a popular magazine." (The name of the magazine
                                is singular, so the verb "is" is used.)</li>
                            <li>"The Mona Lisa <strong>is</strong> famous." (The title of the painting is treated as
                                singular, so "is" is used.)</li>

                <h3>Common Mistakes:</h3>
                <p>Some common mistakes when using passive voice:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Incorrect: "The letter is wrote by him."</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Explanation: The verb "<strong>wrote</strong>" is the past form, not the past
                                participle. In passive voice, the main verb must be in its past participle form.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Correct: "The letter is written by him."
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Incorrect: "The book is reading by them."</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Explanation: The verb "<strong>reading</strong>" is in the present participle form,
                                which is incorrect in passive voice. The past participle "<strong>read</strong>" should
                                be used instead.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Incorrect: "The homework was complete by the student."</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Explanation: The verb "<strong>complete</strong>" is in the base form. In passive voice,
                                the past participle "<strong>completed</strong>" should be used.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Correct: "The homework was completed by the student."

                    <li>
                        <strong>Incorrect: "The movie was being watched by we."</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Explanation: The pronoun "<strong>we</strong>" is incorrectly used in the object form.
                                The correct object pronoun is "<strong>us</strong>."
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Correct: "The movie was being watched by us."

                            <li>
                                Explanation: The verb "<strong>make</strong>" is in the base form. In passive voice, the
                                past participle "<strong>made</strong>" should be used.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                <h3>Tricks to Identify Active and Passive Voice:</h3>
                <p>Use these simple tricks to quickly determine whether a sentence is in active or passive voice:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trick 1: Look for the subject performing the action.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the subject is performing the action, the sentence is in the active voice.</li>
                            <li>
                                Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Active: "The dog chased the ball."
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The subject "<strong>dog</strong>" performs the action
                                                "<strong>chased</strong>." Hence, it is active.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Passive: "The ball was chased by the dog."
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The subject "<strong>ball</strong>" receives the action "<strong>was
                                                    chased</strong>." Hence, it is passive.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trick 2: Look for the auxiliary verb "to be."</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Passive sentences often use a form of the verb "<strong>to be</strong>" (e.g., is, are,
                                was, were) along with the past participle of the main verb.</li>
                            <li>
                                Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Passive: "The cake <strong>is baked</strong> by the chef."
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The verb "<strong>is baked</strong>" indicates passive voice because
                                                "<strong>is</strong>" is a form of "to be."</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Active: "The chef bakes the cake."
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>No auxiliary "<strong>to be</strong>" verb is present. Hence, it is
                                                active.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trick 3: Check for the phrase "by + agent."</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Passive sentences often include the phrase "<strong>by + agent</strong>" to show who is
                                performing the action.</li>
                            <li>
                                Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Passive: "The house <strong>was painted by the workers</strong>."
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The phrase "<strong>by the workers</strong>" indicates passive voice.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Active: "The workers painted the house."
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>No "<strong>by</strong>" phrase is used. Hence, it is active.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trick 4: Replace the verb with a simple form like "eat."</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If "eat" fits into the sentence structure as "<strong>is eaten</strong>," it's likely
                                passive.</li>
                            <li>
                                Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Active: "The chef <strong>cooked</strong> the meal."
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Replace "<strong>cooked</strong>" with "eat": "The chef eat the meal"
                                                (sounds correct, so it's active).</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Passive: "The meal <strong>was cooked</strong> by the chef."
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Replace "<strong>was cooked</strong>" with "is eaten": "The meal is
                                                eaten by the chef" (fits well, so it's passive).</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Trick 5: Focus on the object.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In passive voice, the object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive
                                sentence.</li>
                            <li>
                                Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Active: "The teacher gave the student a book."
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The object "<strong>a book</strong>" remains an object, so it's active.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                            <li>The object "<strong>a book</strong>" is now the subject. Hence, it is
                                                passive.</li>

            <h2>Indianism: Commonly Used Words and Phrases to Be Avoided in Formal Language</h2>
            <p>Indianism refers to words, phrases, or sentence structures influenced by regional languages in India that
                deviate from standard formal English usage. These are common in casual conversations but should be
                avoided in professional or academic contexts.</p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Common Examples of Indianisms:</h3>
                <p>Here are some phrases or usages that are often considered incorrect or informal:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Use of "revert back"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Please revert back to me.</li>
                            <li>Correct: Please revert to me.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Revert" already means "to respond," so "back" is redundant.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "prepone"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Let's prepone the meeting.</li>
                            <li>Correct: Let's move the meeting earlier/forward.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Prepone" is not standard English. You should say "move the meeting
                                earlier" or "reschedule."</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Use of "passing out"</strong>

                            <li>Incorrect: He passed out from college last year.</li>
                            <li>Correct: He graduated from college last year.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: In English, "pass out" means to faint, while "graduate" refers to
                                completing a course of study.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "only" for emphasis</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: I will do it like this only.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I will do it like this.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: Adding "only" in this context is unnecessary and incorrect.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "out of station"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: I am out of station for a week.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I am out of town for a week.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Out of station" is a literal translation from Indian languages; "out of
                                town" is the proper English phrase.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>"Discuss about"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: Let’s discuss the project.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Discuss" already means to talk about something, so "about" is redundant.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Correct: Please take the necessary action.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Do the needful" is an outdated phrase; it's clearer to say "take the
                                necessary action" or "please address this."</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Using "redundant" expressions like "with regards to"</strong>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Correct: Regarding your email.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Regarding" is more concise and correct.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "pass out" for alcohol consumption</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: He passed out after drinking too much alcohol.</li>
                            <li>Correct: He blacked out after drinking too much alcohol.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Passed out" usually means fainting or losing consciousness, but when
                                referring to the effects of alcohol, "blacked out" is more accurate.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "kindly" excessively</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Kindly let me know if you are available.</li>
                            <li>Correct: Please let me know if you are available.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Kindly" can sound overly formal or old-fashioned. "Please" is more
                                commonly used in modern English.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use of "backside" for location</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: The park is at the backside of the house.</li>
                            <li>Correct: The park is behind the house.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Backside" refers to a person's rear. For location, use "behind."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "order for" instead of "order"</strong>

                            <li>Incorrect: I would like to order for a coffee.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I would like to order a coffee.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Order" doesn’t need "for"; it’s already implied.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Use of "today morning" or "yesterday night"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: I saw him today morning.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I saw him this morning.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "This morning" is the correct phrase. Similarly, it should be "last night,"
                                not "yesterday night."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Use of "cousin brother" or "cousin sister"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: My cousin brother lives in Delhi.</li>
                            <li>Correct: My cousin lives in Delhi.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: In English, "cousin" already implies a relative, so adding "brother" or
                                "sister" is unnecessary.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Use of "off the light"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: Please turn off the light.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Off" isn’t a verb. You should use "turn off" when referring to lights or
                                appliances.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Explanation: "Ago" is the correct word for expressing past time, not "back."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Use of "order for a meal"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: I’ll order a meal online.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: The phrase "for" is redundant here.</li>

                    <li><strong>Use of "out of station"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: I was out of town last week.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Out of station" is commonly used in India, but internationally, "out of
                                town" is the standard phrase.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Use of "myself" as the subject</strong>

                            <li>Incorrect: Myself John, and I’m calling from ABC company.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I am John, and I’m calling from ABC company.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Myself" is a reflexive pronoun and should not be used as the subject of a
                                sentence. Use "I am" or just "I."</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Correct: One of my friends is coming tomorrow.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: After "one of," use the plural form of the noun (friends) because you’re
                                referring to one person from a group.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Correct: What is your name?</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Good name" is an Indianism. In English, you simply ask for someone's name.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Correct: She is very beautiful.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Too much" implies excess in a negative sense, while "very" is used for
                                emphasis in a positive sense.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Explanation: "By-hearted" is not correct English. "Memorized" is the right term when you
                                learn something by memory.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Explanation: "As you wish" is the proper idiomatic expression. "As per your wish" is
                                overly formal and awkward.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Using "put a mail" instead of "send an email"</strong>

                            <li>Explanation: "Having" is used for ongoing actions, while "have" is used to show

                            <li>Explanation: Repeating adjectives like "big big" is an Indianism. Instead, use "very" or
                                another qualifier.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Correct: I will give blood.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Donate" is used when you give something permanently, while "give" is the
                                correct verb in this medical context.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "keep the phone" instead of "hang up the phone"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: This question is not in the syllabus.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: The correct expression is "not in the syllabus" or "outside the syllabus."
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Explanation: "Passed out" means losing consciousness. The correct term for finishing
                                school is "graduated."</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Using "time pass" instead of "passing time"</strong>

                            <li>Incorrect: We are doing time pass.</li>
                            <li>Correct: We are just passing time.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Time pass" is an Indianism; the correct phrase in English is "passing
                                time" or "killing time."</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Using "cent percent" instead of "100 percent"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: He scored 100 percent on the test.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Cent percent" is an Indianism, while "100 percent" is the correct form.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Correct: We are working on the upgrade of the system.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Upgradation" is not standard English. Use "upgrade" instead.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "good self" instead of "you"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: How are you?</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Good self" is an overly formal expression and unnecessary. Simply use
                                "you."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "today itself" for emphasis</strong>

                            <li>Incorrect: I’ll send the document today itself.</li>
                            <li>Correct: I’ll send the document today.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: Adding "itself" for emphasis is unnecessary and incorrect in English.</li>

                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "do the needful"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Please do the needful.</li>
                            <li>Correct: Please take the necessary action.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Do the needful" is outdated. The modern expression is "take the necessary
                                action."</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Correct: Please turn off the fan.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: You "turn off" appliances like fans, not "close" them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "same to you" as a greeting reply</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: Happy birthday! Same to you!</li>
                            <li>Correct: Happy birthday! (No need to say "same to you" unless the greeting applies to
                                both people.)</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Same to you" is only used when the same greeting or wish applies to both
                                people (e.g., "Happy New Year"). For unique situations, just acknowledge the greeting.

                            <li>Correct: Don’t lose your keys.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Loose" means not tight, while "lose" refers to misplacing something.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "furnitures" instead of "furniture"</strong>

                            <li>Correct: I bought new furniture for the house.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Furniture" is an uncountable noun, so it doesn't take a plural form.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "passed away" for inanimate objects</strong>

                            <li>Correct: My phone stopped working yesterday.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Passed away" is used only for people or animals who die. For objects, say
                                "stopped working" or "broke."</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Using "years completed" instead of "years old"</strong>

                    <li><strong>Using "shifted" instead of "moved"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incorrect: We shifted to a new house last week.</li>
                            <li>Correct: We moved to a new house last week.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Shifted" refers to changing position or adjusting something, while "moved"
                                is the correct verb for relocating to a new place.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "on tomorrow" instead of "tomorrow"</strong>

                            <li>Explanation: "Tomorrow" doesn't require the preposition "on." It stands alone.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Using "each and every" together</strong>

                            <li>Correct: I checked every item.</li>
                            <li>Explanation: "Each" and "every" both imply completeness, so using them together is
                                redundant. Choose one or the other.</li>
                        </ul>
