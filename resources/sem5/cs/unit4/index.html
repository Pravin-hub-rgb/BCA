                <h3>Types of Reading Comprehension</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>General Statement Followed by Support: A general statement is introduced, followed by supporting
                        details or evidence that clarify or substantiate the main point. For example, a broad statement
                        is made about a topic, and then facts, statistics, or examples are used to support it.</li>
                    <li>Description followed by conclusion or summing up: This structure provides a detailed description
                        of an event, process, or concept, followed by a conclusion or a summary that encapsulates the
                        main ideas. This helps in providing clarity and finality to the discussion.</li>
                    <li>Cause and Effect Relationship: This type of writing explains the cause (why something happened)
                        and the effect (what happened as a result). It outlines a sequence of events or actions and
                        explores how one led to the other.</li>
                    <li>Chronological Presentation of information: Information is presented in the order in which it
                        occurred, starting from the earliest event and moving towards the most recent. This structure is
                        useful in storytelling, history writing, or process explanations.</li>
                    <li>Comparison and contrast: This approach highlights the similarities and differences between two
                        or more subjects, ideas, or phenomena. It is used to draw distinctions and make clear the
                        relationships between items being compared.</li>
                    <li>Narration: Narration is the storytelling approach where an event, situation, or sequence of
                        actions is described, often in the first or third person. It can be used in essays, novels, or
                        any form of storytelling.</li>
                    <li>Problem and solution: This structure starts by introducing a problem or challenge and then
                        presents one or more solutions or strategies to address it. It’s commonly used in essays,
                        proposals, or reports.</li>
                    <li>Spatial / Description: This type of writing focuses on describing a scene, object, or place in
                        detail, using spatial organization to guide the reader through the description. It helps create
                        vivid imagery in the reader’s mind.</li>
                    <li>Discursive: A discursive essay explores a topic from different angles and presents arguments for
                        and against a particular viewpoint. It may not necessarily have a firm conclusion but aims to
                        present a balanced discussion on the subject.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Strategies to Solve Reading Comprehension</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Skimming: Skimming involves quickly reading through the text to get a general sense of its
                        meaning. It helps to identify the main ideas, key themes, and overall structure without focusing
                        on every single word. This is useful when you need to get a broad overview of the material.</li>
                    <li>Scanning: Scanning is a technique where you search for specific information within the text,
                        such as dates, names, or keywords. It is a focused reading strategy that allows you to locate
                        particular details without reading everything in the passage.</li>
                    <li>Context Clues: This strategy involves using the surrounding text to help understand the meaning
                        of unfamiliar words or phrases. By paying attention to definitions, examples, or contrasting
                        ideas nearby, you can often deduce the meaning of unknown terms.</li>
                    <li>Elimination Method: The elimination method is a technique used to narrow down possible answers
                        in multiple-choice questions by eliminating clearly incorrect options. This increases the
                        chances of selecting the correct answer by focusing on the remaining choices.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    "In the early 20th century, industrialization began to reshape the global economy. With advancements
                    in technology, industries such as steel production, transportation, and communication flourished,
                    creating new opportunities for employment and business. The rise of factories and the mass
                    production of goods led to urbanization, as people moved from rural areas to cities in search of
                    work. However, this rapid industrial growth also brought with it social and environmental
                    challenges, such as poor working conditions, pollution, and income inequality. Over time, reforms
                    were introduced to address these issues, leading to improved labor laws, environmental protections,
                    and a more balanced distribution of wealth."

                <h3>Comprehension Exercise: Reading and Answering Questions</h3>
                <p>In this exercise, you will read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.</p>

                <h4>Passage:</h4>
                <p>
                    "The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the 'lungs of the Earth,' plays a crucial role in
                    maintaining the global climate. Spanning across nine countries in South America, it is home to an
                    incredible variety of flora and fauna, many of which are still undiscovered. The rainforest helps
                    absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases in the
                    atmosphere. However, the Amazon is facing significant threats, particularly from deforestation
                    caused by illegal logging, agriculture, and urbanization. The loss of trees not only impacts
                    biodiversity but also disrupts the balance of the global climate. Efforts are being made by
                    governments, environmental organizations, and local communities to combat deforestation and protect
                    the rainforest for future generations."

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Why is the Amazon rainforest referred to as the 'lungs of the Earth'?</strong><br>
                        The Amazon rainforest is referred to as the 'lungs of the Earth' because it absorbs large
                        amounts of carbon dioxide, helping to regulate the global climate and reduce greenhouse gases.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>What are some of the threats that the Amazon rainforest is facing?</strong><br>
                        The Amazon rainforest is facing threats from deforestation caused by illegal logging,
                        agriculture, and urbanization.</li>
                    <li><strong>How does the Amazon rainforest contribute to the reduction of greenhouse
                            gases?</strong><br>
                        The rainforest absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide, which helps reduce the amount of
                        greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mitigating the effects of climate change.</li>
                    <li><strong>What are the consequences of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest?</strong><br>
                        Deforestation impacts biodiversity by destroying habitats for numerous species and disrupts the
                        balance of the global climate by releasing stored carbon back into the atmosphere.</li>
                    <li><strong>What efforts are being made to protect the Amazon rainforest?</strong><br>
                        Efforts being made include initiatives by governments, environmental organizations, and local
                        communities to combat deforestation and preserve the rainforest for future generations.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Identify the introductory sentence: It usually sets the theme of the paragraph.</li>
                    <li>Look for logical connectors: Words or phrases that show relationships (like 'because',
                        'therefore', etc.).</li>
                    <li>Consider the concluding sentence: This usually summarizes or closes the argument presented in
                        the paragraph.</li>
                    <li>Pay attention to pronouns: They often refer to something mentioned earlier, so the order of
                        sentences matters.</li>
