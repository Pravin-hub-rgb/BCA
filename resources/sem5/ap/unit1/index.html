            <h2>Understanding Android Runtime</h2>
            <p>The Android Runtime (ART) is a crucial part of the Android operating system responsible for executing
                applications. Initially, Android used the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM), but transitioned to ART to
                enhance performance and efficiency. This section explores the Android Runtime, compares it with the Java
                Virtual Machine (JVM), and explains the differences and reasons for these changes.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>1. Overview of Android Runtime</h3>
                <p>Android Runtime enables the execution of Android applications by providing a runtime environment. ART
                    replaced DVM to improve overall performance and battery efficiency. This section provides an
                    overview of ART and its key features.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>2. Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)</h3>
                <p>The Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) was the initial runtime environment used by Android to execute
                    applications. It was designed specifically for mobile devices with limited resources.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Characteristics:</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Register-Based Model:</b> DVM uses a register-based architecture, which is more
                                memory-efficient compared to the stack-based model used by JVM.</li>
                            <li><b>Dalvik Bytecode:</b> Executes Dalvik Executable (.dex) files. Each Android
                                application runs in its own process with a dedicated instance of DVM.</li>
                            <li><b>Memory Efficiency:</b> Designed for low-memory devices, allowing multiple instances
                                of DVM to run efficiently.</li>
                            <li><b>JIT Compiler:</b> From Android 2.2, DVM included a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that
                                compiles bytecode into machine code at runtime to improve performance.</li>
                        </ol>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>3. Android Runtime (ART)</h3>
                <p>ART replaced DVM starting from Android 4.4 (KitKat) to address performance and efficiency issues,
                    providing a more robust runtime environment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Characteristics:</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>AOT Compiler:</b> ART uses Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, converting bytecode into
                                machine code during the build process. This results in faster app startup times and
                                improved runtime performance.</li>
                            <li><b>Battery Performance:</b> ART enhances battery life by reducing the need for frequent
                                JIT compilation, which is resource-intensive.</li>
                            <li><b>Garbage Collection:</b> ART offers more efficient garbage collection compared to DVM,
                                leading to better memory management.</li>
                            <li><b>Storage & Boot Time:</b> ART requires more storage and results in longer boot times
                                as it builds a cache during the first boot.</li>
                        </ol>

                                memory and is slower compared to DVM's register-based model.</li>
                            <li><b>Bytecode Execution:</b> Executes Java bytecode (.class files) and is
                                platform-independent, supporting multiple operating systems.</li>
                            <li><b>Single Instance:</b> Typically, a single JVM instance is shared among multiple
                                applications.</li>
                            <li><b>Process:</b> Java source code → Javac → Bytecode → JVM → Machine code</li>

                <h3>6. ART vs. DVM</h3>
                <p>ART and DVM have different impacts on performance and system resources. This section compares ART and
                    DVM based on several factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Battery Performance:</b> ART improves battery life compared to DVM by reducing the need for
                        frequent JIT compilation.</li>
                    <li><b>Storage:</b> DVM is more suitable for devices with low storage due to its less
                        resource-intensive nature.</li>
                    <li><b>Boot Time:</b> ART results in longer boot times as it builds a cache during the first boot,
                        which can be a trade-off for improved performance.</li>
                    <li><b>Application Launch Time:</b> DVM has a slower launch time for applications compared to ART,
                        which benefits from AOT compilation.</li>
                    <li><b>Garbage Collection:</b> ART has more efficient garbage collection, leading to better memory
                        management compared to DVM.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>The transition from DVM to ART represents a significant enhancement in the Android runtime environment.
                ART's advanced features, including AOT compilation and improved garbage collection, address the
                limitations of DVM, resulting in better performance, efficiency, and battery life for Android devices.

            <h2>Android Boot Process</h2>
            <img src="../../images/ap11.jpeg" alt="">

            <p>Android, like any operating system, goes through a series of steps to start up the device and make the
                system ready for user interaction. These steps are crucial to initialize hardware, system services, and
                load the core framework that supports Android applications. Below, we will explain each stage in detail:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Boot ROM</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you press the power button, the device hardware (like the CPU) receives power.</li>
                <li><strong>Boot ROM</strong> is the first component that runs, which is part of the hardware itself.
                </li>
                <li>Its job is to load the <strong>bootloader</strong> into RAM (the device’s main memory) from a fixed
                    location (often the internal storage).</li>
                <li>This step is critical as it kicks off the entire boot process by giving the system a way to start
                    executing the bootloader.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Bootloader</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the <strong>bootloader</strong> is loaded into RAM, it starts executing.</li>
                <li>The bootloader works in two stages:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> It detects the external RAM (device memory) and ensures that the
                        system has enough memory to continue. It also prepares the system for the next steps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> In this stage, the bootloader sets up important parts of the system,
                        such as network configurations and memory allocation.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Kernel</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The bootloader then hands over control to the <strong>Linux Kernel</strong>, which is the core of
                    the Android operating system.</li>
                <li>The kernel is responsible for:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Setting up cache and protected memory areas.</li>
                    <li>Initializing input/output (I/O) systems, such as touchscreens, USB, and Wi-Fi.</li>
                    <li>Loading device drivers (for hardware like the camera, audio, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Starting essential system processes, called <em>daemons</em> (background services that keep the
                        system running).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The kernel then searches for the first system process called <strong>init</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Init Process</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Init</strong> is the first process started by the kernel.</li>
                <li>Its role is to mount key system directories, such as:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>/sys</code> - contains system configuration files.</li>
                    <li><code>/dev</code> - contains device files representing hardware components.</li>
                    <li><code>/proc</code> - contains process information.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The init process also runs an <strong>init.rc</strong> script, which sets up system properties and
                    triggers the <strong>Zygote</strong> process (which handles app management).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Zygote</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zygote</strong> is a critical process that helps Android manage applications more
                    efficiently.</li>
                <li>Its goal is to launch applications by:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preloading core library classes that apps need to run (e.g., Java libraries).</li>
                    <li>Creating a shared memory space that allows multiple instances of the Dalvik Virtual Machine
                        (DVM) to use the same code, saving memory.</li>
                    <li>Starting applications quickly by copying the memory space instead of starting from scratch.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. System Server and Services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Once Zygote is initialized, it starts the <strong>System Server</strong>, which is responsible for
                    launching important Android services like:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Power Manager</li>
                    <li>Activity Manager</li>
                    <li>Telephony Manager</li>
                    <li>Package Manager</li>
                    <li>Bluetooth and Sensor Services</li>
                    <li>Other core system services (e.g., Alarm Manager, Battery Manager, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Once these services are up and running, the system broadcasts an
                    <strong>"ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED"</strong> signal, indicating that the system is fully booted and
                    ready for use.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Android boot process is a layered sequence that starts from the hardware level (Boot ROM) and ends
                with launching core system services via Zygote. Each step ensures that the hardware and software are
                correctly initialized, allowing the Android operating system to function smoothly and efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Android Development Tools</h2>

            <p>Android development relies on a variety of tools that help developers create, test, and debug their
                applications. These tools ensure that Android apps function correctly across different devices and
                operating systems. Understanding these tools is essential for efficient Android development. In this
                section, we will cover key Android tools like the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM), Android Virtual Device
                (AVD) Manager, Android SDK Manager, Android Emulator, DDMS, and the resource folder, highlighting their
                roles and how they relate to each other in the development workflow.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)</h3>

            <p>The <strong>Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)</strong> is a core part of Android's runtime environment,
                responsible for running applications. The DVM is designed specifically for mobile devices, optimizing
                memory usage, battery life, and performance. It allows multiple instances of applications to run
                efficiently in a low-memory environment, which is crucial for mobile devices.</p>

            <p>When you write Android code in Java, the code is first compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler
                (Javac). Then, it is further converted into Dalvik bytecode using the Dex compiler, generating a ".dex"
                file that runs on the DVM. Although Android has since moved to the ART runtime, understanding DVM is
                still important for understanding the evolution of Android development.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Role:</strong> Executes Android applications by interpreting ".dex" files.</li>
                <li><strong>Relation to other tools:</strong> DVM works with the Android SDK and other development tools
                    to run apps on actual devices or emulators.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager</h3>

            <p>The <strong>AVD Manager</strong> is an essential tool that allows developers to create and manage virtual
                devices for testing. These virtual devices, called Android Virtual Devices (AVDs), emulate the hardware
                and software environment of real Android devices, enabling developers to test their applications on
                different device configurations, screen sizes, and API levels without needing physical devices.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Role:</strong> Helps in creating and managing virtual devices to simulate various Android
                    environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Relation to other tools:</strong> Works in tandem with the Android Emulator to provide a
                    platform for running and testing apps in a simulated environment.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Android SDK Manager</h3>

            <p>The <strong>Android SDK Manager</strong> is used to download, install, and manage different components of
                the Android SDK, such as tools, system images, platform versions, and libraries. The SDK (Software
                Development Kit) provides the essential development tools required for building Android applications.
                The SDK Manager ensures that the development environment is up to date and includes all the necessary
                components.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Role:</strong> Manages the Android SDK components, ensuring developers have the tools needed
                    to build applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Relation to other tools:</strong> Integrates with Android Studio and other IDEs to provide
                    updates and configurations for building Android apps.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Android Emulator</h3>

            <p>The <strong>Android Emulator</strong> is a powerful tool that mimics an Android device on your computer,
                allowing you to run and test Android applications without needing physical hardware. It simulates a
                variety of configurations, such as different screen sizes, resolutions, and Android versions, making it
                a valuable tool for testing apps under different conditions.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Resource Folder (Res)</h3>

            <p>The <strong>resource folder</strong> (<code>res/</code>) in Android projects stores non-code resources
                such as XML layouts, UI strings, images, and other drawable assets. These resources are organized into
                subdirectories, and Android automatically loads the correct resources based on the device configuration
                (e.g., screen size, orientation, or language).</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Role:</strong> Holds essential non-code assets such as layouts, images, and strings used by
                    the application.</li>
                <li><strong>Relation to other tools:</strong> Resources from the <code>res/</code> folder are linked in
                    the app's code and used by tools like the AVD Manager and Android Emulator to render the app’s UI
                    during testing.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <p>In Android development, tools like the DVM, AVD Manager, SDK Manager, Emulator, DDMS, and the resource
                folder play a crucial role in ensuring that developers can efficiently build, test, and debug their

            <h2>First Android Program: Hello World</h2>

            <p>In Android, the simplest way to get started is by creating an application that displays the text "Hello
                World" on the screen. Below, we will discuss the classes and methods used in the basic 'Hello World'
                app.</p>

            <h3>1. Main Components of the "Hello World" Android Program</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>MainActivity.java</strong>: This is the main entry point of the app. It's a Java file where
                    you define the behavior of the app's interface.</li>
                <li><strong>activity_main.xml</strong>: This is the layout file where the UI of the app is defined, like
                    buttons, text, etc. For the 'Hello World' program, it will simply contain a TextView that displays
                    "Hello World".</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. MainActivity.java</h3>

            <p>This class is the backbone of any Android app. In this case, we are using Java to code the app’s
                behavior. Here's a simplified version of the "Hello World" code and an explanation of its elements:</p>

            <pre>
                <code> 
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    }
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>MainActivity:</strong> This is the class that controls the main screen of the app. It
                    extends <i>AppCompatActivity</i>, which provides backward compatibility for older Android
                    versions.</li>
                <li><strong>onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState):</strong> This is the method that runs when the activity
                    is created. It sets up the initial state of the app. The <i>Bundle</i> parameter holds the
                    saved state of the activity (if any), which allows restoring the state when the app is relaunched.
                </li>
                <li>Why do we pass Bundle savedInstanceState?
                    <ul>
                        <li>When your activity is temporarily destroyed (for example, when you rotate the phone or switch to another app), Android might want to recreate it later. To do this, it saves certain important data in the Bundle object.</li>
                        <li>If there's data in the Bundle, it means Android is trying to restore your activity to the way it was before it was destroyed. If the Bundle is null, it means the activity is starting fresh, with no previous saved state.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>setContentView(R.layout.activity_main):</strong> This method sets the layout of the
                    activity, defined in the <i>activity_main.xml</i> file. It links the XML layout to the Java
                    code.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. activity_main.xml</h3>

            <p>This is the XML file where the app's user interface is designed. In our case, the interface is quite
                simple, with just a TextView displaying "Hello World".</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Hello World!"
        android:textSize="24sp"
        android:layout_gravity="center"/&gt;

&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>LinearLayout:</strong> This is a container that arranges child elements in a single
                    direction, either vertically or horizontally. Here, it's set to vertical.</li>
                <li><strong>TextView:</strong> This widget displays the "Hello World!" message. We can set the text
                    size, gravity, and other attributes to customize its appearance.</li>
                <li><strong>android:text:</strong> The text attribute holds the message that will be displayed to the
                    user, which is "Hello World!" in this case.</li>
                <li><strong>android:layout_gravity:</strong> This property centers the TextView within the parent
                    layout.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. Breakdown of Key Classes & Methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AppCompatActivity:</strong> This is a base class for activities that wish to use modern
                    features while providing backward compatibility with older Android versions. It provides important
                    functions like managing the activity lifecycle.</li>
                <li><strong>onCreate(Bundle):</strong> This method is called when the activity is first created. It is
                    used to initialize the activity's UI and logic. Here, we use it to link our layout (XML) file to the
                    Java file.</li>
                <li><strong>TextView:</strong> A user interface element that displays text to the user. It is part of
                    the <i>android.widget</i> package and is used in the layout file.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>5. Running the Program</h3>
            <p>Once you create the "Hello World" program, you can run it on either an emulator or a physical Android
                device. The app will display a screen with "Hello World!" in the center.</p>
