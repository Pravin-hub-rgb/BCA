                <p>Broadcast receivers listen for and respond to system-wide broadcast announcements or events. They
                    handle events such as incoming calls or system changes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> React to system-wide events or messages, such as network connectivity changes or
                        battery low warnings.</li>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> A receiver that listens for changes in network connectivity and updates the
                        app’s UI accordingly.</li>
                    <li><b>Usage:</b> Implemented by extending the BroadcastReceiver class and registering intents in

                    interface for data access and manipulation across different apps.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> Facilitate data sharing and querying between different apps and manage data
                        storage.</li>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> Contacts provider that allows apps to access and modify the user’s contact
                        information.</li>
                    <li><b>Usage:</b> Implemented by extending the ContentProvider class and defining URIs for accessing

            <p>The Android Runtime (ART) is a crucial part of the Android operating system responsible for executing
                applications. Initially, Android used the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM), but transitioned to ART to
                enhance performance and efficiency. This section explores the Android Runtime, compares it with the Java
                Virtual Machine (JVM), and explains the differences and reasons for these changes.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>1. Overview of Android Runtime</h3>
                <p>Android Runtime enables the execution of Android applications by providing a runtime environment. ART
                    replaced DVM to improve overall performance and battery efficiency. This section provides an
                    overview of ART and its key features.</p>

                <h3>2. Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)</h3>
                <p>The Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) was the initial runtime environment used by Android to execute
                    applications. It was designed specifically for mobile devices with limited resources.</p>

                            <li><b>Register-Based Model:</b> DVM uses a register-based architecture, which is more
                                memory-efficient compared to the stack-based model used by JVM.</li>
                            <li><b>Dalvik Bytecode:</b> Executes Dalvik Executable (.dex) files. Each Android
                                application runs in its own process with a dedicated instance of DVM.</li>
                            <li><b>Memory Efficiency:</b> Designed for low-memory devices, allowing multiple instances
                                of DVM to run efficiently.</li>
                            <li><b>JIT Compiler:</b> From Android 2.2, DVM included a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that
                                compiles bytecode into machine code at runtime to improve performance.</li>

                    <li><b>Characteristics:</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>AOT Compiler:</b> ART uses Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, converting bytecode into
                                machine code during the build process. This results in faster app startup times and
                                improved runtime performance.</li>
                            <li><b>Battery Performance:</b> ART enhances battery life by reducing the need for frequent
                                JIT compilation, which is resource-intensive.</li>
                            <li><b>Garbage Collection:</b> ART offers more efficient garbage collection compared to DVM,
                                leading to better memory management.</li>
                            <li><b>Storage & Boot Time:</b> ART requires more storage and results in longer boot times
                                as it builds a cache during the first boot.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                <h3>4. JVM vs. DVM</h3>
                <p>Comparing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) helps understand why
                    Android switched from DVM to ART and the differences in their architectures.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>JVM (Java Virtual Machine):</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Stack-Based Model:</b> JVM uses a stack-based architecture, which requires more
                                memory and is slower compared to DVM's register-based model.</li>
                            <li><b>Bytecode Execution:</b> Executes Java bytecode (.class files) and is
                                platform-independent, supporting multiple operating systems.</li>
                            <li><b>Single Instance:</b> Typically, a single JVM instance is shared among multiple
                                applications.</li>
                            <li><b>Process:</b> Java source code → Javac → Bytecode → JVM → Machine code</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>DVM (Dalvik Virtual Machine):</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Register-Based Model:</b> More memory-efficient and faster for mobile devices with
                                limited resources.</li>
                            <li><b>Dalvik Bytecode:</b> Executes .dex files specific to Android, optimized for low-power
                                devices.</li>
                            <li><b>Multiple Instances:</b> Allows multiple instances of DVM to run efficiently, each
                                handling its own application.</li>
                            <li><b>Process:</b> Android source code → Javac → Bytecode → Dex compiler (dex tool) →
                                Dalvik Bytecode (.dex file) → DVM → Machine code</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. JIT vs. AOT Compilation</h3>
                <p>JIT and AOT compilation are methods used to improve application performance, operating at different
                    stages of the development process.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation:</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Runtime Compilation:</b> JIT compiles bytecode into machine code at runtime,
                                enhancing performance but consuming more resources during execution.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) Compilation:</b>

                            <li><b>Build-Time Compilation:</b> AOT compiles code during the build process, leading to
                                faster app startup times and better runtime performance.</li>
                        </ol>

                <h3>6. ART vs. DVM</h3>
                <p>ART and DVM have different impacts on performance and system resources. This section compares ART and
                    DVM based on several factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Battery Performance:</b> ART improves battery life compared to DVM by reducing the need for
                        frequent JIT compilation.</li>
                    <li><b>Storage:</b> DVM is more suitable for devices with low storage due to its less
                        resource-intensive nature.</li>
                    <li><b>Boot Time:</b> ART results in longer boot times as it builds a cache during the first boot,
                        which can be a trade-off for improved performance.</li>
                    <li><b>Application Launch Time:</b> DVM has a slower launch time for applications compared to ART,
                        which benefits from AOT compilation.</li>
                    <li><b>Garbage Collection:</b> ART has more efficient garbage collection, leading to better memory
                        management compared to DVM.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>The transition from DVM to ART represents a significant enhancement in the Android runtime environment.
                ART's advanced features, including AOT compilation and improved garbage collection, address the
                limitations of DVM, resulting in better performance, efficiency, and battery life for Android devices.

            <h2>Android Boot Process</h2>
            <img src="../../images/ap11.jpeg" alt="">

            <p>Android, like any operating system, goes through a series of steps to start up the device and make the
                system ready for user interaction. These steps are crucial to initialize hardware, system services, and
                load the core framework that supports Android applications. Below, we will explain each stage in detail:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Boot ROM</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you press the power button, the device hardware (like the CPU) receives power.</li>
                <li><strong>Boot ROM</strong> is the first component that runs, which is part of the hardware itself.
                </li>
                <li>Its job is to load the <strong>bootloader</strong> into RAM (the device’s main memory) from a fixed
                    location (often the internal storage).</li>
                <li>This step is critical as it kicks off the entire boot process by giving the system a way to start
                    executing the bootloader.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Bootloader</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the <strong>bootloader</strong> is loaded into RAM, it starts executing.</li>
                <li>The bootloader works in two stages:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> It detects the external RAM (device memory) and ensures that the
                        system has enough memory to continue. It also prepares the system for the next steps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> In this stage, the bootloader sets up important parts of the system,
                        such as network configurations and memory allocation.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Kernel</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The bootloader then hands over control to the <strong>Linux Kernel</strong>, which is the core of
                    the Android operating system.</li>
                <li>The kernel is responsible for:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Setting up cache and protected memory areas.</li>
                    <li>Initializing input/output (I/O) systems, such as touchscreens, USB, and Wi-Fi.</li>
                    <li>Loading device drivers (for hardware like the camera, audio, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Starting essential system processes, called <em>daemons</em> (background services that keep the
                        system running).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The kernel then searches for the first system process called <strong>init</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Init Process</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Init</strong> is the first process started by the kernel.</li>
                <li>Its role is to mount key system directories, such as:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>/sys</code> - contains system configuration files.</li>
                    <li><code>/dev</code> - contains device files representing hardware components.</li>
                    <li><code>/proc</code> - contains process information.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The init process also runs an <strong>init.rc</strong> script, which sets up system properties and
                    triggers the <strong>Zygote</strong> process (which handles app management).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Zygote</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zygote</strong> is a critical process that helps Android manage applications more
                    efficiently.</li>
                <li>Its goal is to launch applications by:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preloading core library classes that apps need to run (e.g., Java libraries).</li>
                    <li>Creating a shared memory space that allows multiple instances of the Dalvik Virtual Machine
                        (DVM) to use the same code, saving memory.</li>
                    <li>Starting applications quickly by copying the memory space instead of starting from scratch.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. System Server and Services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Once Zygote is initialized, it starts the <strong>System Server</strong>, which is responsible for
                    launching important Android services like:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Power Manager</li>
                    <li>Activity Manager</li>
                    <li>Telephony Manager</li>
                    <li>Package Manager</li>
                    <li>Bluetooth and Sensor Services</li>
                    <li>Other core system services (e.g., Alarm Manager, Battery Manager, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Once these services are up and running, the system broadcasts an
                    <strong>"ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED"</strong> signal, indicating that the system is fully booted and
                    ready for use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Android boot process is a layered sequence that starts from the hardware level (Boot ROM) and ends
                with launching core system services via Zygote. Each step ensures that the hardware and software are
                correctly initialized, allowing the Android operating system to function smoothly and efficiently.</p>
