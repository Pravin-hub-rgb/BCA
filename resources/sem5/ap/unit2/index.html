            <h2>Android - Application Components</h2>

            <p>In Android, an application is composed of several key components that work together to create a
                functional and interactive app. These components manage different aspects of the application’s behavior
                and interaction with users and other apps.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>1: Activities</h3>
                <p>Activities represent a single screen with a user interface. They are crucial for interacting with
                    users and are often considered the entry points of an application.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> Display UI elements and handle user interactions.</li>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> A settings screen or a login page.</li>
                    <li><b>Lifecycle:</b> Activities go through various states such as created, started, resumed,
                        paused, stopped, and destroyed.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>2: Services</h3>
                <p>Services run in the background to perform long-running operations or tasks without user interaction.
                    They continue to run even if the user switches to another app.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> Handle tasks like playing music, performing network operations, or handling
                        system-level functions.</li>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> A music player that continues playing audio in the background.</li>
                    <li><b>Types:</b> Foreground services (display notifications to keep the user informed) and
                        background services (perform tasks without user visibility).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>3: Broadcast Receivers</h3>
                <p>Broadcast receivers listen for and respond to system-wide broadcast announcements or events. They
                    handle events such as incoming calls or system changes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> React to system-wide events or messages, such as network connectivity changes or
                        battery low warnings.</li>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> A receiver that listens for changes in network connectivity and updates the
                        app’s UI accordingly.</li>
                    <li><b>Usage:</b> Implemented by extending the BroadcastReceiver class and registering intents in
                        the manifest or at runtime.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>4: Content Providers</h3>
                <p>Content providers manage and share app data with other applications. They provide a standard
                    interface for data access and manipulation across different apps.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> Facilitate data sharing and querying between different apps and manage data
                        storage.</li>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> Contacts provider that allows apps to access and modify the user’s contact
                        information.</li>
                    <li><b>Usage:</b> Implemented by extending the ContentProvider class and defining URIs for accessing
                        data.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Additional Components</h3>
                <p>Besides the main components, there are other essential elements in Android applications that enhance
                    functionality and user experience.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Views:</b> Basic building blocks for UI elements like buttons, text fields, and images. They
                        are used to display content and handle user interactions.</li>
                    <li><b>Fragments:</b> Reusable portions of an activity’s UI that can be combined to create a
                        flexible and dynamic user interface.</li>
                    <li><b>Layouts:</b> Define the structure and arrangement of UI elements on the screen. Examples
                        include LinearLayout and RelativeLayout.</li>
                    <li><b>Intents:</b> Messages used to request actions from other components or apps. They can be used
                        to start activities, services, or deliver broadcasts.</li>
                    <li><b>Resources:</b> Assets such as strings, images, and layouts that are used by the application.
                        They are defined in XML files in the res directory.</li>
                    <li><b>Manifest:</b> The AndroidManifest.xml file contains essential information about the app, such
                        as its components, permissions, and configuration details.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Android Activity</h2>

            <p>An <strong>Activity</strong> in Android is a crucial component that provides the window in which an app
                draws its user interface (UI). Each activity represents a single screen in an Android application, much
                like a window or frame in Java. The activity window typically takes up the full screen but can be
                resized or float over other windows in certain scenarios.</p>

            <p>Activities allow developers to place all UI components or widgets in a single screen. Generally, each
                activity corresponds to one screen of the app. For example, one activity may handle a
                <em>Preferences</em> screen, while another may manage a <em>Select Photo</em> screen.
            </p>

            <p>The Android <strong>Activity</strong> class is a subclass of <code>ContextThemeWrapper</code>, meaning it
                inherits the ability to apply themes and styles to its UI components.</p>

            <h3>Key Characteristics of an Activity:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents a single screen in the app.</li>
                <li>Handles user interaction and UI display for that screen.</li>
                <li>Can be resized or float over other windows.</li>
                <li>It manages the lifecycle of the screen, controlling how the app behaves in response to user
                    interaction and system changes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Android Activity Lifecycle</h3>
            <img src="../../images/ap1.png" alt="">
            <p>The Android Activity Lifecycle refers to the various states that an activity can exist in as it moves
                between foreground and background or when it gets interrupted by another activity. These states define
                how an activity behaves and manages its resources. There are four main states:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Active (Running)</strong>:<br>
                    If the activity is in the foreground, it is considered <em>active</em> or <em>running</em>. This is
                    the activity that the user is currently interacting with.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Visible</strong>:<br>
                    When an activity loses focus but is still visible to the user, it is in the <em>visible</em> state.
                    This can happen if another activity (e.g., a popup) partially obscures it. In this state, the
                    activity remains alive, retaining its state and staying attached to the window manager.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Stopped (Hidden)</strong>:<br>
                    If an activity is completely hidden by another activity, it enters the <em>stopped</em> state. While
                    hidden, it retains all its state and member information but its window is no longer visible. The
                    system may kill this activity if it needs to free memory for other applications.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Destroyed</strong>:<br>
                    When an activity is removed from memory, either by the system or by the user finishing it, it is
                    considered <em>destroyed</em>. When an activity is recreated, it must be restarted and restored to
                    its previous state.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The activity lifecycle is crucial for managing an Android app's resources efficiently. Understanding
                these states helps in designing applications that perform well under different conditions, such as
                interruptions or multitasking. Activities provide the foundation for user interaction by managing the
                screen, handling user inputs, and maintaining their states as they transition through various lifecycle
                stages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Android Toast</h2>
            <p>A <strong>Toast</strong> is a small message that pops up on the screen for a short duration, providing
                feedback to the user. Unlike a dialog, a toast does not block user interaction with the app, making it
                useful for showing non-intrusive messages like "Task completed," "Network error," or "File saved
                successfully."</p>

            <h3>Why Use a Toast?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Non-intrusive way to show messages.</li>
                <li>Does not require user action to disappear (auto-dismissed after a set duration).</li>
                <li>Useful for brief notifications or status updates.</li>
                <li>Ideal for informing the user of a background task's completion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Basic Syntax of Toast</h3>
            <p>In Android, a <code>Toast</code> message can be created and displayed using the following syntax:</p>

            <pre>
<code>Toast.makeText(context, message, duration).show();</code>
    </pre>

            <p>Let’s break this down:</p>

            <h3>Arguments Passed to a Toast</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Context</strong>: The context in which the toast is created. This is usually the current
                    Activity. The context provides the necessary information about the app environment to the toast.
                    Example: <code>this</code> or <code>getApplicationContext()</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Message</strong>: The text or message you want to display to the user. This can be a simple
                    string or a string resource. Example: <code>"Hello, World!"</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Duration</strong>: The length of time the toast should appear on the screen. There are two
                    predefined values:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>Toast.LENGTH_SHORT</code>: Displays the toast for a short period (~2 seconds).</li>
                        <li><code>Toast.LENGTH_LONG</code>: Displays the toast for a longer period (~3.5 seconds).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example of a Basic Toast</h3>
            <pre>
        <code>
Toast.makeText(this, "Hello, World!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        </code>
    </pre>

            <p><strong>Step-by-Step Explanation:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>this</strong>: Refers to the current activity context.</li>
                <li><strong>"Hello, World!"</strong>: This is the message that will be displayed on the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Toast.LENGTH_SHORT</strong>: The duration for which the toast will be shown (approximately 2
                    seconds).</li>
                <li><strong>.show()</strong>: This method ensures that the toast is actually displayed to the user.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Android Activity Lifecycle - Sample Program</h2>

            <p>We already know that the Android Activity Lifecycle describes the different states an activity goes
                through
                from
                its creation
                to its destruction. Below is a sample Android program that uses <strong>Toast</strong> messages to
                indicate
                when different lifecycle methods are called. This will help you understand how activities transition
                through these states.</p>
            <p>In this example, we'll implement a simple Android activity that displays a Toast message for each
                lifecycle method:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>onCreate()</code></li>
                <li><code>onStart()</code></li>
                <li><code>onResume()</code></li>
                <li><code>onPause()</code></li>
                <li><code>onStop()</code></li>
                <li><code>onDestroy()</code></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Activity Lifecycle Program Code</h3>
            <pre>
                <code>
package com.example.lifecycleexample;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.Toast;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        Toast.makeText(this, "Activity Created", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        Toast.makeText(this, "Activity Started", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        Toast.makeText(this, "Activity Resumed", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        Toast.makeText(this, "Activity Paused", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        super.onStop();
        Toast.makeText(this, "Activity Stopped", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        Toast.makeText(this, "Activity Destroyed", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
}
    </code>

            <h3>Explanation of the Program</h3>
            <p>This program demonstrates how to use <code>Toast</code> messages to track the lifecycle of an Android
                activity. Here’s what each lifecycle method does:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>onCreate():</strong> Called when the activity is first created. This is where you initialize
                    your UI components and perform setup tasks. In this method, we show a Toast message saying "Activity
                    Created".</li>
                <li><strong>onStart():</strong> Called when the activity is becoming visible to the user. This method is
                    used for actions that need to occur when the activity is visible but not yet interactive. Here, we
                    display a Toast message saying "Activity Started".</li>
                <li><strong>onResume():</strong> Called when the activity starts interacting with the user. This is
                    where you should start processes or actions that need to be active while the activity is in the
                    foreground. We use a Toast message saying "Activity Resumed" in this method.</li>
                <li><strong>onPause():</strong> Called when the activity is no longer in the foreground but still
                    visible. This method is used to save data or stop processes that should not continue while the
                    activity is partially obscured. The Toast message "Activity Paused" is shown here.</li>
                <li><strong>onStop():</strong> Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user. Use this
                    method to release resources that are not needed while the activity is stopped. We show a Toast
                    message saying "Activity Stopped" in this method.</li>
                <li><strong>onDestroy():</strong> Called before the activity is destroyed. This method is where you
                    perform final cleanup of resources. A Toast message saying "Activity Destroyed" is shown in this
                    method to indicate that the activity is about to be removed from memory.</li>
            </ul>
