                <p>Basic Question</p>
                <p>Q: A can do a piece of work in 20 days, and B alone can do it in 30 days. In how many days can A and
                    B
                    complete the work together?</p>
                <pre>
        Time       Total work    Efficiency 
A ->  20 Days     60 Units      60/20 = 3 units 
B ->  30 Days                   60/30 = 2 units
            </pre>
                <p>
                    LCM of days = 60 <br>
                    Assume total work = 60 Units<br>
                    Next, we find efficiency. Efficiency is the work completed in a given time (days, minutes, hours)
                    according to the question.<br>
                    Now, we get to know that A takes 20 days to complete 60 units of work.<br>
                    <b>Work done in one day by A = 60/20 = 3 units</b><br>
                    Work done in one day by B = 60/30 = 2 units<br>
                    Now, if both A and B work together, then 3 + 2 = 5 units of work will be completed in a day.<br>
                    Therefore, 60 units of work at the rate of 5 units per day will take 60/5 = 12 days.<br>
                    So, when A and B work together, the work will be done in 12 days.<br>
                    <b>Formula:</b><br>
                    Time = Work / Efficiency <br>
                    In this case, Work = 60 units, and the combined efficiency of both A and B is 5 units/day.<br>
                    Therefore, Time = 60 / 5 = 12 days.

                    do it in 25 days. In how many days can A alone finish the work?</p>
                <pre>
          Time        Total Work     Efficiency 
A + B =  15/2 days      75 units   (75 * 2) / 15  = 10 
    B =  25 days                    75 / 25        = 3
</pre>
                <p>
                    While taking the LCM ignore the denominator part. <br>
                    Combined efficiency of A and B = 10 units/day<br>
                    Efficiency of B alone = 3 units/day<br>
                    Therefore, efficiency of A alone = 10 - 3 = 7 units/day<br>
                    <b>Formula:</b><br>
                    Time = Work / Efficiency<br>

                <pre>
             Time        Total Work    Efficiency
A + B + C    8 days                        9
    B       18 days        72 units        4

                </pre>
                <p>
                    Combined efficiency of A, B, and C = 9 units/day<br>
                    Efficiency of B alone = 4 units/day<br>
                    Efficiency of C alone = 3 units/day<br>
                    Therefore, efficiency of A alone = 9 - 4 - 3 = 2 units/day<br>
                    <b>Formula:</b><br>
                    Time = Work / Efficiency<br>
                    Time taken by A alone = 72 / 2 = 36 days<br>
                    Hence, A can complete the work in 36 days alone.

                <pre>
A takes to do 1/2 of the work in 5 days
    for 1 unit it takes 5 * 2 = 10 days 
B takes to do 3/5 of the work in 9 days 
    for 1 unit it takes (9 / (3/5)) = 15 days 
C takes to do 2/3 of the work in 8 days

                    Total efficiency (sum of A, B, and C) = 6 + 4 + 5 = 15 units/day<br>

</pre>
                <p>
                    Efficiency of A + B = 15 units/day<br>
                    Efficiency of B + C = 5 units/day<br>
                    Efficiency of C + A = 14 units/day<br>
                    <br>
                    From A + B = 15, we get: B = 15 - A<br>
                    Substitute B in B + C: (15 - A) + C = 5<br>
                    C + 15 - A = 5<br>
                    C - A = -10<br>
                    C = A - 10<br>
                    <br>
                    Substitute C in C + A = 14: (A - 10) + A = 14<br>
                    A - 10 + A = 14<br>
                    2A - 10 = 14<br>
                    2A = 24<br>
                    A = 12<br>
                    <br>
                    Now, C = A - 10<br>
                    C = 12 - 10<br>
                    C = 2<br>
                    Efficiency of C alone = 2 units/day<br>
                    Total work = 120 units<br>
                    Time taken by C alone = Work / Efficiency<br>
                    Time = 120 / 2 = 60 days<br>
                    Hence, C alone can complete the work in 60 days.<br><br>
                    So, we can also find it like this:<br>
                    Efficiency of A + B = 15 units/day<br>
                    Efficiency of B + C = 5 units/day<br>
                    Efficiency of A + C = 14 units/day<br>
                    Sum of all efficiencies: 2(A + B + C) = 34 units/day<br>
                    Therefore, A + B + C = 34 / 2 = 17 units/day<br>
                    We know A + B = 15 units/day<br>
                    So, 15 + C = 17<br>
                    C = 17 - 15<br>
                    C = 2<br>
                    Efficiency of C alone = 2 units/day
                    <br>
                    Total work = 120 units<br>
                    Time taken by C alone = Work / Efficiency<br>
                    Time = 120 / 2 = 60 days<br>
                    Hence, C alone can complete the work in 60 days.

                <p>
                    If A and B work together, they will complete 9 units of work in a day<br>
                    In 5 days, both worked together, so:<br>
                    5 * 9 = 45 units of work completed in 5 days<br>
                    Remaining work which A has to do = 100 - 45 = 55 units<br>

                    Using the formula T = W / E:<br>

                    T = 11 days<br>

                    Combined efficiency of A and B = 17 units/day<br>

                    <br>A = 7.5 - 5
                    <br>A = 2.5 units/day
                    <br><br>

P   10 days 
    so in 10 days 40% = 2/5 of the work is done, which means

    1 unit of work in 5 days, so 5 units of work in 25 days 
Q   18 days 
    so in 18 days 75% = 3/4 of the work is done, which means

In two consecutive days from the beginning, 13 units of work are done.
            </pre>
                <p>
                    13 units -> 2 days <br>
                    Total work = 42 units; we don't have to exceed it. <br>
                    The multiple of 13 which is under 42 is 13 * 3 = 39. <br>
                    39 units -> 6 days <br>
                    But our work is not completed. <br>
                    42 - 39 = 3 units of work are left. <br>
                    An important point: This remaining work will be assigned to the person who started the work, in this
                    case, A. <br>
                    Shortcut: 6 whole days + remaining days / A's efficiency <br>
                    = 6 (3/7) days <br>
                    Now, how did this 3/7 come from? <br>
                    A can do 7 units in one day. <br>
                    So, for 1 unit, he will take 1/7 day. <br>
                    Now, for 3 units, he will take 3 * 1/7 = 3/7 days. <br>
                    So, the answer will be 6(3/7) days.
