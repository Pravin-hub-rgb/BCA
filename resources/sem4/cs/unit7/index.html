        <h1>Time, Speed & Distance</h1>
        <h3>Relation Between Time, Speed, and Distance</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Speed = Distance / Time</strong></li>
            <li>If time is constant, there is a direct relationship between speed and distance. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Suppose A and B are traveling with speeds of 60 km/h and 40 km/h respectively, and the time t is
                        fixed at 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>The distance traveled by A = 2 * 60 = 120 km</li>
                    <li>The distance traveled by B = 2 * 40 = 80 km</li>
                    <li>The ratio of their speeds is 60:40 or 3:2.</li>
                    <li>The ratio of their distances is 120:80 or 3:2, showing that distance is directly proportional to
                        speed when time is constant.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If the distance is constant, speed and time are inversely proportional to each other. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Suppose A and B are traveling a fixed distance of 120 km.</li>
                    <li>A travels at a speed of 60 km/h, so the time taken by A = 120 / 60 = 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>B travels at a speed of 40 km/h, so the time taken by B = 120 / 40 = 3 hours.</li>
                    <li>The ratio of their speeds is 60:40 or 3:2.</li>
                    <li>The ratio of their times is 2:3, showing that time is inversely proportional to speed when
                        distance is constant.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If A starts at 10 PM and moves towards B with a speed of 80 km/h, and B also starts at 10 PM and moves
                towards A with a speed of 20 km/h, they will meet at point X. At point X, they took the same amount of
                time. No matter the speed, they will take the same amount of time to meet, but the one with the greater
                speed will cover more distance. Therefore, A will be closer to B's starting point. This demonstrates
                that speed impacts distance. In summary, if two bodies start at the same time and move towards each
                other, the one with the higher speed will cover more distance, and they will meet at the same time.<ul>
                    <li>Example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A and B start at 10 PM.</li>
                            <li>A's speed = 80 km/h</li>
                            <li>B's speed = 20 km/h</li>
                            <li>Suppose they meet after t hours.</li>
                            <li>The distance covered by A in t hours = 80t km</li>
                            <li>The distance covered by B in t hours = 20t km</li>
                            <li>If the total distance between them is D, then 80t + 20t = D</li>
                            <li>100t = D</li>
                            <li>So, t = D / 100</li>
                            <li>Both A and B will take the same time t to meet at point X, but A will cover a greater
                                distance (80t km) compared to B (20t km).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
