            <h2>What is Ratio?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A ratio is a way to compare two quantities by dividing them to find their simplest form. For
                    example:
                    <br>Given the numbers 1000 and 500, if we divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor
                    (GCD), we
                    get:
                    <br>2 : 1
                    <br>This means the ratio of 1000 to 500 is 2:1, indicating that 1000 is twice as much as 500.
                </li>
                <li>A ratio is a comparative term. For instance:
                    <br>If we have the numbers 1000 and 500, we may not immediately understand their relationship.
                    However,
                    when we express these numbers as a ratio, like 2:1, it becomes clear that 1000 is twice as much as
                    500.
                    Ratios are particularly useful in more complex comparisons.
                </li>
                <li>A ratio is not an actual value but a representation of the relationship between two quantities. For
                    example:
                    <br>If a recipe calls for a ratio of 2 cups of flour to 1 cup of sugar, it means that the amount of
                    flour is double the amount of sugar, regardless of the actual measurements used.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>a : b = 3 : 4 and b : c = 8 : 9<br>
                    So what will be a : b : c?</h3>
                <pre>
a : b  |  b : c 
3 : 4  |  8 : 9
                </pre>
                <p>We have 'b' as the common term in both ratios. <br> To find a common ratio that includes 'a', 'b',
                    and 'c', we need to make the value of 'b' the same in both ratios. <br> Currently, 'b' is 4 in the
                    first ratio and 8 in the second ratio. <br>To make 'b' the same, we can multiply the first ratio by
                    2:</p>
                <pre>
2 * (3 : 4) = 6 : 8
                </pre>
                <p>Now we have:</p>

                <p>Therefore, the combined ratio a : b : c will be:</p>
                <pre>
a : b : c = 6 : 8 : 9

                        Here we basically write the ratio in step-wise order and the spaces that are left are filled by
                        the nearest number available. Then, we multiply the column values and finally divide the ratio
                        by any GCD.

                        <br>(A's income - 400) / (B's income - 400) = 3 / 2

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We start with the given ratios:
                        <br>The ratio of salary per male to female is 3:2.
                        <br>The ratio of the number of male to female employees is 5:4.

                    <li>
                        To find the ratio of the total amount distributed, we multiply the salary ratio by the number
                        ratio:

                <ul>
                    <li>Let's denote the cost of an apple by A and the cost of a mango by M.</li>
                    <li>Given the ratio of their prices: A / M = 3 / 4, which implies A = 3k and M = 4k for some
                        constant k.</li>
                    <li>We are given that the cost of 10 apples and 15 mangoes is Rs. 360:</li>
                    <pre>
        10A + 15M = 360
    </pre>
                    <li>Substituting the values of A and M in terms of k:
                        <pre>
        10(3k) + 15(4k) = 360
        30k + 60k = 360
        90k = 360
        k = 360 / 90
        k = 4
    </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Now, find the cost of 50 apples and 60 mangoes:
                        <pre>
        A = 3k = 3 * 4 = 12
        M = 4k = 4 * 4 = 16

        Cost of 50 apples = 50 * 12 = 600
        Cost of 60 mangoes = 60 * 16 = 960

        Total cost = 600 + 960 = 1560
    </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Therefore, the cost of 50 apples and 60 mangoes is Rs. 1560.</li>

                    Remember: The one who invests more money over a longer period will get better returns.
                    <br>For example, if A invested Rs. 10,000 for 10 months and B invested Rs. 20,000 for 2 months:
                    <br>A's total investment = 10,000 * 10 = 100,000 (1 lakh)
                    <br>B's total investment = 20,000 * 2 = 40,000
                    <br>So, A will earn more money.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finding the ratio of profit earned by A and B:

                    <br>Simplified ratio: 2:5

                        A invested Rs. 20,000 for 8 months, so total investment = 20,000 * 8 = 160,000 (160K).

                        So, A has 2 unit shares and B has 3 unit shares from the annual profit of Rs. 2500.
