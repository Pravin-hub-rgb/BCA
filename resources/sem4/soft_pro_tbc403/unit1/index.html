                    <li>The process is decomposed into a relatively small set of tasks, and the effort required to
                        accomplish each task is estimated.</li>
                    <li>Once problem functions and process activities are identified, the planner estimates the effort
                        (e.g., person-months) that will be required to accomplish each software process activity for
                        each software function.</li>
                    <li>Average labor rates (cost per unit effort) are then applied to the estimated effort for each
                        process activity.</li>
                    <li>It is very likely that labor rates (cost per unit effort) will vary for each task.</li>
                    <li>Senior staff heavily involved in early activities are generally more expensive than junior

                    estimation models.</li>
                <li>This model relies on the size of the software, which is typically measured by the number of lines of

                    product development.</li>

            <h2>Cost-Benefit Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                A cost-benefit analysis model for reengineering, as proposed by Sneed, involves the consideration of
                nine parameters:
            <ul>
                <li>P1: Current annual maintenance cost for an application</li>
                <li>P2: Current annual operations cost for an application</li>
                <li>P3: Current annual business value of an application</li>
                <li>P4: Predicted annual maintenance cost after reengineering. (Reengineering refers to the process of
                    making significant modifications or enhancements to
                    the existing system to improve its performance, functionality, or other relevant aspects.)
                </li>
                <li>P5: Predicted annual operations cost after reengineering</li>
                <li>P6: Predicted annual business value after reengineering</li>
                <li>P7: Estimated reengineering cost</li>
                <li>P8: Estimated reengineering calendar time</li>
                <li>P9: Reengineering risk factor (P9 = 1.0 is nominal)</li>
                <li>L: Expected life of the system</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The cost associated with continuing maintenance of a candidate application (i.e., reengineering is not
                performed) can be defined as:
                C_maint = (P3 - (P1 + P2)) * L
            </p>

            <p>
                The costs associated with reengineering are defined using the following relationship:
                C_reeng = P6 - (P4 + P5) * (L - P8) - (P7 * P9)
            </p>

            <p>
                Using the costs presented in Equations (1) and (2), the overall benefit of reengineering can be computed
                as:
                Cost benefit = C_reeng - C_maint
            </p>
