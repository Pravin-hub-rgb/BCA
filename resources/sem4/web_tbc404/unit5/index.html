                                development.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>WAMP is a development stack specifically designed for Windows environments, providing a

            <h2>Introduction to PHP</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What PHP Stands For:</strong> PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, reflecting its primary
                    purpose of processing hypertext or web pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Server-Side Scripting Language:</strong> PHP is a server-side scripting language used to
                    manage dynamic content on webpages. It runs on the server, generating HTML content that is then sent
                    to the client's browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Interpreter-Based Language:</strong> PHP is an interpreter-based language, meaning there's
                    no need for compilation. PHP scripts are executed directly by the PHP interpreter on the server.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> PHP is known for its speed and performance compared to other scripting
                    languages like ASP and JSP, making it a popular choice for web development.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration with HTML:</strong> PHP can be seamlessly embedded within HTML, allowing
                    developers to mix PHP code with HTML markup to create dynamic web pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> PHP supports object-oriented programming (OOP)
                    concepts, enabling developers to create modular, reusable code with classes and objects.</li>
                <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> PHP is an open-source scripting language, which means it's freely
                    available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity and Ease of Use:</strong> PHP is known for its simplicity and ease of
                    understanding, making it accessible to beginners and experienced developers alike.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Features of PHP:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> PHP scripts execute faster than languages like ASP and JSP. PHP
                        utilizes its own memory management, reducing server workload and minimizing loading times for
                        web pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> PHP's source code and software are freely available, allowing
                        developers to access and modify the language according to their needs. All PHP versions and
                        components are downloadable and usable at no cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Embeddable:</strong> PHP code can be seamlessly embedded within HTML tags and scripts,
                        enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> PHP is compatible with various operating systems such as
                        Unix, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Applications developed in PHP on one operating system can
                        easily run on other platforms, enhancing cross-platform compatibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> PHP includes predefined error reporting mechanisms that
                        generate notices or warnings during runtime, aiding developers in identifying and resolving
                        errors in their code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weakly Typed Language:</strong> PHP is a weakly typed or loosely typed language,
                        allowing variables to be used without declaring their data types. The type of data and its value
                        determine the variable's type during execution.</li>
                    <li><strong>File Storage:</strong> PHP uses different directories for file storage, such as 'htdocs'
                        for XAMPP and 'www' for WAMP. Developers must create these folders to organize and store PHP
                        files and resources effectively.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>PHP uses a combination of HTML, JavaScript-like syntax, and PHP-specific tags to execute
                        server-side code.</li>
                </ul>
                <pre>
                    <code>
&lt;? php 
    echo ("PHP")
?>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the above code, we have used PHP opening and closing tags
                        &lt;?php ?> to encapsulate PHP code. The echo statement is used to output the text "PHP" to the
                        webpage.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>File Extension</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>PHP files typically use the .php extension, indicating that the file contains PHP code that
                        needs to be processed by the PHP interpreter on the server.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Running PHP Scripts Locally</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Install XAMPP or WAMP:</strong>
                        <ul>

                                for WAMP).</li>
                            <li>Create a new PHP file (e.g., <code>abc.php</code>) or place an existing PHP file in this
                                directory.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>In the address bar, type <code>http://localhost/abc.php</code> (replace
                                <code>abc.php</code> with your PHP file name).
                            </li>
                            <li>If using a different port, specify the port in the URL (e.g.,
                                <code>http://localhost:8080/abc.php</code>).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Execute the PHP Script:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The local server will process the PHP script and display the output in your web browser.
