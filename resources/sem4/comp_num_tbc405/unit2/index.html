            <h2>Matrices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The evolution of the concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and simple
                    methods of solving systems of linear equations. Matrices are not only used as representations of the
                    coefficients in the system of linear equations, but their utility exceeds that initial use.</li>

            <h3>Applications of Matrices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Matrices are used in business and scientific fields such as budgeting, sales projection, cost
                    estimation, and analyzing the results of experiments.</li>
                <li>Physical operations such as magnification, rotation, and reflection through a plane can be
                    represented mathematically by matrices.</li>

                    <li>Convert the linear equation into a matrix in the form AX = B, where A is the matrix of

                <ul>
                    <li>In linear algebra, Gaussian elimination is an efficient algorithm for solving systems of linear
                        equations.</li>

                            <li>Elimination or triangular elimination</li>

                <p><strong>Steps for Gauss Elimination</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Convert the equation into matrix form, i.e., AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is
                        the matrix of unknowns, and B is the result matrix.</li>
                    <li>The obtained matrix will also be augmented as [AB].</li>
                    <li>Choose the pivot element as A<sub>11</sub> if it is nonzero.</li>
                    <li>Take the pivot element and make the elements below it zero:

                        called a well-conditioned system. Conversely, when the variation in the determinant is very
                        high, it
                        is referred to as an ill-conditioned system.</li>

            <h2>Interpolation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Interpolation is a statistical method used to estimate unknown values based on related known values.
                </li>
                <li>It involves constructing a function that passes through known data points, allowing for the
                    estimation of values within the range of those data points.</li>
                <li>Interpolation is commonly used in various fields such as mathematics, engineering, computer science,
                    and data analysis.</li>
                <li>The accuracy and reliability of interpolation depend on factors such as the distribution and quality
                    of the known data points, the chosen interpolation method, and any assumptions made about the
                    underlying data behavior.</li>

                    <li>Conditions:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The function should be tabulated at equal intervals, such as regularly spaced values
                                like 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., to ensure the accuracy of the interpolation process.</li>
                            <li>The point for which the function is to be interpolated should lie in the first or upper
                                half of the table. This means that the value you're trying to estimate falls within the
                                range of known data points towards the beginning or top part of the data set.</li>
