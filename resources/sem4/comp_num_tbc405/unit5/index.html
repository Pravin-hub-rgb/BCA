        <h1>Time series</h1>
        <p>A time series is a sequence of data points recorded at regular time intervals, used to track changes over
            time.</p>
        <p>A time series refers to a sequential collection of data points or observations recorded over time intervals.
            These intervals could be regular (daily, weekly, monthly) or irregular, depending on the nature of the data
            being observed.</p>

        <p>Here's how the rest of the text could be expanded and corrected:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Time series data is of particular interest in economics, business, and commerce, where the values of a
                variable are observed chronologically by days, weeks, months, quarters, or years. This type of data
                provides insights into trends, patterns, and relationships over time, which are crucial for
                decision-making and analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Time series analysis is conducted primarily for two main purposes:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>To make forecasts for the future based on historical data trends. This forecasting helps businesses
                    and economists anticipate market trends, sales patterns, economic indicators, and other variables
                    crucial for planning and strategy.</li>
                <li>To evaluate past performance and understand the dynamics of the data over time. This includes
                    identifying seasonality, trends, cycles, and irregular fluctuations that can impact decision-making
                    and strategy formulation.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Applications of time series analysis are widespread:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Economists use time series analysis to estimate figures such as national income, inflation rates,
                    unemployment rates, and other key economic indicators. This information is vital for economic
                    policy-making, forecasting, and understanding economic trends.</li>
                <li>Businesses utilize time series analysis for sales forecasting, demand planning, inventory
                    management, financial modeling, and risk management. It helps businesses optimize operations,
                    allocate resources efficiently, and make informed decisions.</li>
                <li>In natural sciences, time series analysis is used in environmental monitoring, climate modeling,
                    geological studies, and more. It aids in understanding natural phenomena, detecting trends, and
                    predicting future events.</li>
                <li>Social scientists apply time series analysis in areas such as demographic studies, population
                    dynamics, crime rates analysis, and public policy evaluation. It provides insights into societal
                    trends, behavior patterns, and policy effectiveness.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Components of time series</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>&star; Secular trend or trend</li>
                <li>&star; Seasonal variations</li>
                <li>Cyclic variations</li>
                <li>Irregular Variations</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Secular Trend</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A secular trend is a long-term pattern or trend in data that shows consistent movement in a
                        single direction over an extended period.</li>
                    <li>Example:- The gradual increase in average global temperatures over the past century is a secular
                        trend.
                        This long-term trend shows a consistent upward movement in temperature data due to climate
                        change.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Seasonal Variations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seasonal variation refers to predictable changes in data that happen at the same time each year.
                        These changes follow a regular pattern due to seasonal factors such as weather, holidays, or
                        cultural events.</li>
                    <li>Example: Electricity use usually increases every summer because people use more air
                        conditioning.
                        This predictable increase in electricity use during the summer months is an example of
                        seasonal variation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Cyclic Fluctuations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cyclic fluctuation or variation refers to repetitive patterns of ups and downs in data over a
                        period of time. Unlike seasonal variation, which occurs at specific times each year, cyclic
                        variation follows a longer-term cycle that repeats at intervals longer than a year.</li>
                    <li>Example: The real estate market often experiences cycles of booms and busts, with periods of
                        rising property prices followed by downturns. This cyclic pattern of price fluctuations, which
                        may last several years, is an example of cyclic variation in the real estate industry.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Irregular Variations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Irregular variation refers to unpredictable or random fluctuations in data that do not follow a
                        specific pattern or cycle. These fluctuations can occur due to various unpredictable factors,
                        such as sudden changes in consumer behavior, unexpected events, or random occurrences.</li>
                    <li>Example: A company's daily sales may experience irregular variation when there is a sudden surge
                        in demand due to a viral social media post about their product. This spike in sales is not part
                        of a regular pattern and is considered an irregular variation in the data.</li>

                <h3>Free Hand Method</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In this method, we visually plot the data points on a graph over time to identify the long-term
                        trend.</li>
                    <li>The steps involved in the free hand method include:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Plot data:
                            Construct a graph with time on the x-axis and the variable of interest on the y-axis. Plot
                            each data point.</li>
                        <li>Identify trend:
                            Analyze the data points to discern the long-term direction (upward, downward, or flat).</li>
                        <li>Draw trend line:
                            Draw a smooth line that captures the overall trend, not every data point.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Upward trend: Line with a positive slope.</li>
                                <li>Downward trend: Line with a negative slope.</li>
                                <li>Flat trend: Line with near-zero slope.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    perfectly match every data point, but rather to capture the general trend.</p>
