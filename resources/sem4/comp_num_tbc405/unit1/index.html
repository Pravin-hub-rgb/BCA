            <h2>Algebraic and transcendental equations Using Iterative Methods</h2>
            <p><strong>We should know What Algebraic and Transcendental Equations Are</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Algebraic equations are mathematical expressions composed of variables and constants, combined using
                    addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. There are several types of algebraic
                    equations, including:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Linear equations - General form ax + b = 0; where a, b are constants and x is the
                            variable.</li>
                        <li>Quadratic equations - General form ax^2 + bx + c = 0; where a, b, c are constants and x is
                            the variable.</li>
                        <li>Polynomial equations - General form P(x) = a<sub>n</sub> x<sup>n</sup> +
                            a<sub>n-1</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup> + ... + a<sub>1</sub>x<sup>1</sup> +
                            a<sub>0</sub>x<sup>0</sup>; where a<sub>n</sub>,
                            a<sub>n-1</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>0</sub> are constants and x is the variable.</li>
                        <li>Rational equations - The general form of a rational equation is P(x) / Q(x) = 0, where P(x)
                            and Q(x) are polynomials.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Transcendental equations are mathematical expressions that involve functions which cannot be
                    expressed algebraically. These functions may include exponential, logarithmic, or trigonometric
                    functions.</li>
                <li>Transcendental equations play a crucial role in modeling a wide range of real-world phenomena. Some
                    notable applications include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Radioactive decay</li>
                        <li>Heat transfer</li>
                        <li>Electromagnetic waves</li>
                    </ol>
                    These equations often defy direct algebraic solutions, necessitating the use of numerical or
                    iterative techniques for finding accurate solutions. The understanding and analysis of
                    transcendental equations are essential in addressing complex scenarios in fields such as physics,
                    engineering, and various scientific disciplines.

                <h3>What is the Root of an Equation?</h3>
                <p>The root of an equation is a value that, when substituted into the equation, makes the equation equal
                    to zero. In other words, it is a solution or solutions that satisfy the equation by reducing it to
                    zero.</p>

                <p>For example, consider the quadratic equation:</p>

                <code>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</code>

                <p>The roots of this equation can be found using the quadratic formula:</p>

                <pre>
x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
</pre>

                <p>In this formula, the values of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are coefficients of
                    the quadratic equation. The ± symbol indicates that there are usually two roots: one with the
                    positive square root and one with the negative square root.</p>

                <p>So, the roots of the quadratic equation are the values of <code>x</code> that, when substituted into
                    the equation, make it equal to zero.</p>

                    <li>Root finding methods are broadly categorized into root bracketing and root polishing methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>Root Bracketing: In these methods, a new interval is obtained from the previous interval, and
                        the root for every interval is determined. In contrast, root polishing methods only find the new
                        root without determining the bracket, making them much faster.</li>

                <h3>Arrangement of the root finding methods in terms of speed, from slower to faster, along with reasons
                    for their speed:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bisection Method: This method is relatively slower because it involves narrowing down the
                        interval by halving it repeatedly until the root is found. It guarantees convergence but can be
                        slower compared to other methods.</li>
                    <li>Regula Falsi Method: Also known as the false position method, this approach is generally slower
                        than some other methods because it combines aspects of both bisection and secant methods, which
                        can lead to slower convergence.</li>
                    <li>Iterative Methods: These methods, such as fixed-point iteration or the method of successive
                        approximations, can be faster than bisection and regula falsi but may still require several
                        iterations to converge, especially for complex functions or poorly chosen initial guesses.</li>
                    <li>Secant Method: The secant method is faster than bisection and regula falsi because it uses
                        secant lines to approximate the root, leading to quicker convergence compared to linear methods
                        like bisection.</li>
                    <li>Newton-Raphson Method: This method is often the fastest among these options because it utilizes
                        both the function and its derivative to iteratively refine the root approximation. It converges
                        quadratically, which means it can converge much faster than linear methods like bisection and
                        even secant.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The bisection method in mathematics is a root-finding technique that involves iteratively
                        bisecting an interval and selecting a subinterval in which a root must lie for further
                        processing. This method is also commonly known as the interval halving method.</li>

                <p><strong>Steps involved in Bisection Method</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Finding the initial guess (assumptions)</li>

                    <li>Finding next bracket: New interval is found out by the following condition.

                    </li>
                    <li>Note: Iterations are continued until the absolute value of the root is greater than epsilon
                        (0.003) or until the specified number of iterations is reached.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Newton-Raphson method takes only a single guess to find the next root. It is the most
                        preferred method for finding the root of an equation and is also known as the method of
                        tangents. Selection of the initial guess ensures that this algorithm converges faster than other
                        algorithms. The next guess is found using the formula. <br>

                    <li>Derivation or differentiation is a mathematical concept that measures how a quantity changes
                        when another related quantity undergoes a change. In simpler terms, it provides a way to
                        understand the rate at which one variable changes concerning another. For example, if we have a
                        function describing the position of an object over time, the derivative of that function with
                        respect to time gives us the object's velocity.</li>
