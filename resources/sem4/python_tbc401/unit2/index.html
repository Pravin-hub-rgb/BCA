            <ul>
                <li>Statistics is the study of data, where data can be any information collected for analysis. For
                    example, in Delhi, data on daily crimes is collected and analyzed to draw conclusions and make
                    informed decisions.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in a set of data.</li>
                    <li>Example: Find the range of the following data set: 3, 3, 5, 5, 8, 9, 9, 9, 13, 15.
                        <br>Range = Largest number - Smallest number
                        <br>Range = 15 - 3 = 12
                        <br>So, the range of this data set is 12.

                    our research.</li>
                <li>It is a crucial aspect of research because the results of the study heavily depend on the sampling
                    technique used. Therefore, choosing the right sampling method is essential to obtain accurate
                    results that can estimate the population well.</li>
                <li>For example, suppose there is a male population in a city, and the unemployment rate among this
                    population is 8%. By sampling a representative group of males, researchers can estimate the overall
                    unemployment rate in the city more accurately.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Population</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Population is a collection of elements or individuals from which we draw a statistical sample for a
                    study. It is the entire group about which we want to draw a conclusion. The number of elements or
                    individuals in a population is called the population size.</li>
                <li><strong>Sample</strong>, on the other hand, is a subset of the population. It is the specific group
                    from which you collect data. The number of elements or individuals in a sample is called the sample
                    size. The process of selecting a sample is called <strong>sampling</strong>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, suppose we are studying the average height of all students in a school. The
                            population would
                            be all the students in the school, and the sample would be a smaller group of students
                            selected for
                            measurement. The size of the population is the total number of students in the school, while
                            the sample
                            size is the number of students actually measured.</li>

                <h3>Why do we need a sample?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>As it is nearly impossible to collect data from each and every individual of the population,
                        sampling helps us attain information about the entire population.</li>
                    <li>While the results from a sample may not be completely accurate, they provide a close
                        approximation
                        of the population. It is crucial that the selected sample is representative of the population
                        and
                        not biased in any manner.</li>
                    <li>For example, consider a study aiming to understand the preferences of coffee drinkers in a city
                        with
                        a large population. Instead of surveying every coffee drinker, which would be impractical,
                        researchers can select a sample of coffee drinkers representing different demographics, such as
                        age,
                        gender, and location. By analyzing this representative sample, researchers can make informed
                        conclusions about the preferences of the entire coffee-drinking population in the city.</li>

                <h3>Sampling techniques</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Simple Random Sampling (SRS):
                        <ul>
                            <li>In Simple Random Sampling, everyone in the population has an equal chance of being
                                picked.
                                It's like picking names out of a hat without looking.</li>
                            <li>Example: If you want to know what students think about a new school rule, you put all
                                their
                                names in a box and randomly pick some names. Each student has the same chance of being
                                chosen for the survey.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Stratified Sampling:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In Stratified Sampling, you divide the population into groups (like by age or gender),
                                then
                                randomly pick from each group. This ensures you get opinions from all types of people.
                            </li>
                            <li>Example: If you're studying favorite colors among kids, you group them by age (e.g.,
                                5-7,
                                8-10, 11-13) and randomly choose kids from each group to get a balanced view.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Cluster Sampling:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In Cluster Sampling, the population is divided into clusters or groups, and then
                                clusters
                                are randomly selected. All individuals within the selected clusters are included in the
                                sample.</li>
                            <li>Cluster sampling can be done in two ways:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Single-stage Cluster Sampling: In this method, all elements within the selected
                                        clusters are included in the sample.</li>
                                    <li>Two-stage Cluster Sampling: Here, a random sample of clusters is selected, and
                                        then
                                        a random sample of individuals is taken from each selected cluster.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Systematic Sampling:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In Systematic Sampling, you pick every nth person from a list after a random start. It's
                                like selecting every 5th person from a line.</li>
                            <li>Example: If you want to survey shoppers in a mall, you start by randomly choosing a
                                shopper
                                and then survey every 10th shopper after that.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Convenience Sampling:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Convenience Sampling is picking whoever is easiest to reach. It's quick but may not
                                represent everyone well.</li>
                            <li>Example: If you ask people in a shopping mall about their favorite TV show, you're using
                                convenience sampling because you're only surveying those who happen to be there at that
                                time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note: The sampling techniques â€” simple, cluster, stratified, and systematic â€” are all
                        probability
                        sampling techniques and involve randomization. However, convenience sampling is a
                        non-probability (or non-random) sampling technique because it relies on the researcherâ€™s ability
                        to select the sample. Non-probability sampling techniques can lead to biased samples and
                        results.

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Resampling Techniques</h3>
                <p>Resampling is a technique used in statistics and machine learning to manipulate the composition
                    of a dataset by adjusting the distribution of its instances. The primary goal of resampling is
                    to address specific issues within the dataset, such as imbalances, outliers, or to improve the
                    generalization performance of a model. There are several common methods of resampling:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Oversampling:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Oversampling involves increasing the number of
                                instances in the minority class to balance the class distribution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It is used to address imbalances in the dataset,
                                especially when one class is underrepresented.</li>
                            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Techniques include random oversampling, Synthetic Minority
                                Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN).</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose you have a dataset with 90% positive cases and 10%
                                negative cases. By oversampling the negative cases, you can create a more balanced
                                dataset for training a classification model.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Undersampling:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances
                                in the majority class to balance the class distribution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It is employed to mitigate imbalances where one class is
                                overrepresented, which can lead to biased models.</li>
                            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Common approaches include random undersampling, Cluster
                                Centroids, Tomek Links, and Edited Nearest Neighbors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> In a dataset with 80% positive cases and 20% negative
                                cases, undersampling the positive cases can help balance the class distribution for
                                better model training.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bootstrapping:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Bootstrapping entails creating multiple subsets of the
                                dataset by sampling with replacement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It is often used in model training and validation to
                                improve model robustness and assess variability in performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Techniques include random bootstrapping and Bagging
                                (Bootstrap Aggregating) in ensemble methods.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> When training a machine learning model, bootstrapping can
                                help create diverse subsets of the data to train different parts of the model,
                                enhancing overall performance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cross-Validation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into
                                multiple subsets for training and testing to assess model performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It helps evaluate a model's ability to generalize by
                                testing it on different subsets of the data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Common types include k-fold cross-validation, stratified
                                cross-validation, Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), and Time Series
                                Cross-Validation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> In machine learning, cross-validation is used to estimate
                                a model's performance on unseen data by training and testing it on different subsets
                                of the dataset.</li>

                <h3>Statistical Inference</h3>
                <p>Statistical inference is a process in statistics that involves drawing conclusions or making
                    predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. It encompasses
                    the use of statistical methods to make inferences about the characteristics of a larger group using
                    the information obtained from a subset of that group.</p>
                <p>There are two main branches of statistical inference:</p>
