        <h1>Introduction to Microprocessor</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A microprocessor is a central processing unit (CPU) integrated onto a single chip.</li>
            <li>It serves as the brain of a computer system, executing instructions and performing calculations to
                enable the functioning of various applications.</li>
            <li>Microprocessors are fundamental components in modern electronic devices, powering not only computers but
                also a wide range of embedded systems, from household appliances to automotive control systems.</li>
            <li>Key features and characteristics of microprocessors include their clock speed, architecture, instruction
                set, and the ability to process data and execute instructions stored in memory.</li>
            <li>They play a crucial role in the overall performance and capabilities of a computing system.</li>
            <li>As technology has advanced, microprocessors have become increasingly powerful, smaller in size, and more
                energy-efficient.</li>
            <li>This continuous evolution has led to improvements in computing speed, efficiency, and the ability to
                handle complex tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Don't get confused between microprocessor, microcontroller, microcomputer, and mainframe</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A microprocessor has memory on a separate chip, making it distinct from a microcontroller.</li>
            <li>Microprocessors are advantageous as they allow for flexibility in memory configuration and expansion.
            </li>
            <li>In contrast, a microcontroller integrates all components, including memory, onto a single chip,
                providing a compact and integrated solution suitable for specific applications.</li>
            <li>Microcomputers, encompassing a broader category, refer to complete computer systems that are smaller in
                scale compared to mainframes.</li>

                <h3>Basic Steps Followed by Microprocessor</h3>
                <ol start="0">
                    <li><strong>Addressing:</strong></li>
                    <p>Before executing any instruction, the microprocessor needs to know where to find the data or
                        operation to be performed. This step involves determining the memory location or register
                        address of the instruction to be processed.</p>

                    <li><strong>Fetch:</strong></li>
                    <p>Once the address is determined, the microprocessor fetches the instruction from the specified
                        memory location. This involves retrieving the binary code representing the instruction and
                        bringing it into the processor's memory for further processing.</p>

                    <li><strong>Decode:</strong></li>
                    <p>After fetching the instruction, the microprocessor decodes the binary code. This step involves
                        interpreting the instruction to understand what operation needs to be performed and which data
                        is involved. The microprocessor determines the specific sequence of actions required for
                        execution.</p>

                    <li><strong>Execute:</strong></li>
                    <p>With the instruction decoded, the microprocessor performs the actual operation or manipulates the
                        data according to the instruction's requirements. This step completes the execution cycle, and
                        the result may be stored back in memory or sent to other components for further processing.</p>
                </ol>

                        flexibility for diverse computing needs.</p>

                    <li><strong>Special Purpose Microprocessor:</strong></li>
                    <p>Special-purpose microprocessors are designed for specific applications or dedicated tasks. Unlike
                        general-purpose processors, they are optimized to excel in particular functions. Examples
                        include microprocessors embedded in devices like washing machines, microwave ovens, or digital
                        cameras, where their design is tailored to efficiently perform the specific tasks associated
                        with the device's functionality. Special-purpose microprocessors are often more power-efficient
