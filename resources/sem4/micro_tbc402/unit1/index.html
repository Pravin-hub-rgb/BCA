        <h1>Introduction to Microprocessor</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A microprocessor is a central processing unit (CPU) integrated onto a single chip.</li>
            <li>It serves as the brain of a computer system, executing instructions and performing calculations to
                enable the functioning of various applications.</li>
            <li>Microprocessors are fundamental components in modern electronic devices, powering not only computers but
                also a wide range of embedded systems, from household appliances to automotive control systems.</li>
            <li>Key features and characteristics of microprocessors include their clock speed, architecture, instruction
                set, and the ability to process data and execute instructions stored in memory.</li>
            <li>They play a crucial role in the overall performance and capabilities of a computing system.</li>
            <li>As technology has advanced, microprocessors have become increasingly powerful, smaller in size, and more
                energy-efficient.</li>
            <li>This continuous evolution has led to improvements in computing speed, efficiency, and the ability to
                handle complex tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Don't get confused between microprocessor, microcontroller, microcomputer, and mainframe</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A microprocessor has memory on a separate chip, making it distinct from a microcontroller.</li>
            <li>Microprocessors are advantageous as they allow for flexibility in memory configuration and expansion.
            </li>
            <li>In contrast, a microcontroller integrates all components, including memory, onto a single chip,
                providing a compact and integrated solution suitable for specific applications.</li>
            <li>Microcomputers, encompassing a broader category, refer to complete computer systems that are smaller in
                scale compared to mainframes.</li>
            <li>Mainframes, in contrast, are powerful computers designed for large-scale data processing and handling
                critical business applications.</li>
        </ul>

            <p><strong>The above diagram contains:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Input device: This component facilitates the entry of data into the microprocessor, allowing it to
                    process information from external sources.</li>
                <li>Output device: Responsible for presenting the processed data or results in a usable form to the user
                    or other parts of the system.</li>
                <li>ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): The ALU performs mathematical and logical operations, crucial for
                    executing instructions and processing data within the microprocessor.</li>
                <li>Register Array: A set of registers that store and quickly provide access to temporary data during
                    the execution of instructions.</li>
                <li>Control Unit: This unit manages and coordinates the operations of various components within the
                    microprocessor, ensuring proper execution of instructions.</li>
                <li>Memory: Stores both data and instructions for the microprocessor to access and utilize during its
                    operation.</li>
            </ul>
