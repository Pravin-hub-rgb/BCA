                <h3>Basic Steps Followed by Microprocessor</h3>
                <p>Before executing any instruction, the microprocessor needs to know where to find the data or
                    operation to be performed. This step involves determining the memory location or register
                    address of the instruction to be processed.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Fetch:</strong></li>
                    <p>Once the address is determined, the microprocessor fetches the instruction from the specified
                        memory location. This involves retrieving the binary code representing the instruction and
                        bringing it into the processor's memory for further processing.</p>

                    <li><strong>Decode:</strong></li>
                    <p>After fetching the instruction, the microprocessor decodes the binary code. This step involves
                        interpreting the instruction to understand what operation needs to be performed and which data
                        is involved. The microprocessor determines the specific sequence of actions required for
                        execution.</p>

                    <li><strong>Execute:</strong></li>
                    <p>With the instruction decoded, the microprocessor performs the actual operation or manipulates the
                        data according to the instruction's requirements. This step completes the execution cycle, and
                        the result may be stored back in memory or sent to other components for further processing.</p>

            <h2>Calculation of Addressable Memory Space</h2>
            <p>
                Addressable memory space refers to the range of memory locations that a computer system can uniquely
                identify and access. The calculation of addressable memory space involves determining the maximum number
                of unique addresses that can be generated by the system.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Key Factors in Addressable Memory Space Calculation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Address Bus Width:</strong> The number of lines in the address bus determines the maximum
                    number of unique addresses that can be represented. A wider address bus allows for a larger
                    addressable memory space.</li>
                <li><strong>Addressability:</strong> The unit of addressability, often expressed in bits, indicates the
                    smallest addressable storage unit. For example, if the addressability is 8 bits, each address points
                    to a byte of memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Formula:</strong> The addressable memory space (N) can be calculated using the formula N =
                    2<sup>(Address Bus Width)</sup>.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong>
                <br>
                If a computer system has a 16-bit address bus, the addressable memory space would be 2^16, resulting in
                64 kilobytes (KB) of addressable memory.

                    instruction decoder then interprets this opcode to determine the operation to be performed.</li>
                <li>The instruction decoder communicates the operation details to the timing and control unit, which
                    generates the necessary control signals to execute the instructions.</li>
                <li>For arithmetic and logical operations, one operand is typically fetched from the accumulator (A),
                    while the other operand is fetched from a temporary register (Temp Register) by the Arithmetic Logic
                    Unit (ALU). The ALU processes this data, and the result is usually stored back in the accumulator,
                    affecting the status flags based on the ALU outcome.</li>
                <li>For example, consider the instruction ADI 45H. The opcode ADI is fetched into the instruction
                    register and decoded by the instruction decoder. Subsequently, the timing and control unit generates
                    a signal to fetch the next byte of the instruction, which in this case is the data value 45H. This
                    data is then loaded into the temporary register for processing by the ALU, and the result is stored
                    back in the accumulator.</li>

                <h3>Power Supply and Clock Frequency:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vcc:</strong> This pin is connected to a +5V power supply, providing the necessary DC
                        voltage for the microprocessor to operate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vss:</strong> Ground reference pin, connected to the ground to complete the electrical
                        circuit and ensure proper functioning of the microprocessor.</li>
                    <li><strong>X1 and X2:</strong> These pins are connected to an external crystal oscillator that
                        helps in generating the clock signals for the microprocessor. The crystal oscillator connected
                        at X1 and X2 determines the internal frequency of the microprocessor, ensuring accurate timing
                        for its operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>CLK(OUT):</strong> This pin outputs the system clock signal generated by the
                        microprocessor. It can be used as a reference clock for other components in the system,
                        synchronizing their operations with the microprocessor's clock cycles.</li>

                        microprocessor. When the RESET IN signal is at a logic low (0), it triggers a reset operation.
                        This signal is active low, meaning it works when brought to a low voltage level.</li>

                            <li>Clearing the Program Counter (PC) and Instruction Register (IR). The PC holds the memory
                                address of the next instruction to be executed, while the IR stores the current
                                instruction being executed.</li>
                            <li>Disabling all interrupts (except TRAP), ensuring that the microprocessor does not
                                respond to external interrupt requests during the reset process.</li>
                            <li>Disabling the Serial Output Data (SOD) pin, which is used for serial data output.</li>
                            <li>Putting all buses (data, address, and control) into a high-impedance or tristate state,
                                disconnecting them from other components to prevent data conflicts.</li>
                            <li>Generating a high output on the RESET OUT pin, indicating that the microprocessor is in
                                a reset state.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        circuits (ICs) in the circuit. It serves as an output signal, becoming active when the RESET IN
                        signal is low (0). The output on this pin remains high as long as the RESET IN signal is kept
                        low, indicating that the reset operation is ongoing.</li>

                <h3>Five Hardware Interrupts in 8085</h3>
                <p>Interrupts in the 8085 microprocessor provide a mechanism for handling time-sensitive tasks and
                    events. There are two main types of interrupts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Maskable Interrupts:</strong> These interrupts can be delayed or temporarily disabled by
                        the microprocessor. They are controlled using software instructions.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>RST 7.5</li>

                        <li>RST 5.5</li>
                        <li>INTR</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI):</strong> This interrupt cannot be delayed or disabled by
                        software instructions. It always remains enabled.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TRAP is a non-maskable interrupt.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Vectored Interrupts:</strong> These interrupts cause the microprocessor to jump to a
                        specific location in memory for handling the interrupt.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>RST 7.5</li>
                        <li>RST 6.5</li>
                        <li>RST 5.5</li>
                        <li>TRAP</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-Vectored Interrupts:</strong> These interrupts do not specify a specific memory
                        location for handling the interrupt.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>INTR</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Priority of Interrupts:</strong> The interrupts are prioritized as follows, with TRAP
                        having the highest priority and INTR the lowest:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>TRAP (max priority)</li>
                        <li>RST 7.5</li>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>TRAP:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>TRAP is a non-maskable interrupt with the highest priority.</li>
                            <li>It cannot be disabled and must be handled immediately.</li>
                            <li>TRAP signal transitions from low to high to trigger the interrupt.</li>
                            <li>The signal must remain high for a specific duration.</li>
                            <li>TRAP is commonly used for critical events like power failure or emergency shutdown.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>RST 7.5:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>RST 7.5 is a maskable interrupt with the second highest priority.</li>
                            <li>It is triggered by a positive edge signal only.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>RST 6.5:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>RST 6.5 is a maskable interrupt with the third highest priority.</li>
                            <li>It is triggered by a level signal only.</li>
                            <li>The pin must be held high for a specific period of time to trigger the interrupt.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>RST 5.5:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>RST 5.5 is a maskable interrupt with the fourth highest priority.</li>
                            <li>It is triggered by a level signal.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>INTR:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>INTR is a maskable interrupt with the lowest priority among the hardware interrupts in
                                the 8085 microprocessor.</li>
                            <li>It is a general-purpose interrupt request signal that can be used by external devices to
                                request the attention of the microprocessor.</li>
                            <li>When an external device sends an interrupt request to the INTR pin, the microprocessor
                                checks if interrupts are enabled and prioritizes the interrupt based on its priority
                                level.</li>
                            <li>If interrupts are enabled and the priority of the INTR interrupt is higher than the
                                currently executing instruction, the microprocessor suspends the current operation and
                                jumps to the interrupt service routine (ISR) to handle the interrupt.</li>
                            <li>The ISR is a predefined section of code that performs specific actions in response to
                                the interrupt, such as handling data transfer, responding to user inputs, or performing
                                critical tasks.</li>
                            <li>Once the interrupt is serviced, the microprocessor returns to the main program and
                                resumes execution from the point where it was interrupted.</li>
                            <li>INTR interrupts can be enabled or disabled using software instructions, allowing the
                                programmer to control the handling of interrupt requests based on the application's
                                requirements.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It is a signal that tells an external device that the microprocessor has acknowledged
                                its interrupt request.</li>
                            <li>When an external device sends an interrupt request, the microprocessor responds by
                                sending INTA, allowing the device to send data or instructions.</li>
                            <li>INTA helps coordinate communication between the microprocessor and external devices
                                during interrupt handling.</li>
                            <li>It plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth operation when handling interrupts in the

            <ul>
                <li>The bus architecture of the Intel 8085 microprocessor consists of three main buses: the address
                    bus, the data bus, and the control bus. Each bus serves a specific purpose in facilitating
                    communication between the microprocessor and external devices.</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Address Bus:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The address bus is a unidirectional bus that carries memory addresses from the
                            microprocessor to external memory devices such as RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM
                            (Read-Only Memory). It specifies the location in memory where data is to be read from or
                            written to.</li>
                        <li>Example: If the microprocessor needs to read data from a ROM chip located at address
                            2000H, it places the address 2000H on the address bus to access the ROM.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Data Bus:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The data bus is a bidirectional bus that carries data between the microprocessor and
                            external devices. It is used to transfer both input and output data between the
                            microprocessor and memory or I/O (Input/Output) devices.</li>
                        <li>Example: When writing data to a RAM chip, the microprocessor places the data on the data
                            bus, and the data is then written to the specified memory location indicated by the
                            address bus.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Control Bus:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The control bus is a collection of various control signals that coordinate and control
                            the operations of the microprocessor and external devices. It includes signals such as
                            Read (RD), Write (WR), Memory/IO (M/IO), and various status signals.</li>
                        <li>Example: The RD signal is activated when the microprocessor wants to read data from an
                            external device, and the WR signal is activated when writing data to an external device.
