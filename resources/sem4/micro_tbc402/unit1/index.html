                <h3>Basic Steps Followed by Microprocessor</h3>
                <ol start="0">
                    <li><strong>Addressing:</strong></li>
                    <p>Before executing any instruction, the microprocessor needs to know where to find the data or
                        operation to be performed. This step involves determining the memory location or register
                        address of the instruction to be processed.</p>

                    <li><strong>Fetch:</strong></li>
                    <p>Once the address is determined, the microprocessor fetches the instruction from the specified
                        memory location. This involves retrieving the binary code representing the instruction and
                        bringing it into the processor's memory for further processing.</p>

                    <li><strong>Decode:</strong></li>
                    <p>After fetching the instruction, the microprocessor decodes the binary code. This step involves
                        interpreting the instruction to understand what operation needs to be performed and which data
                        is involved. The microprocessor determines the specific sequence of actions required for
                        execution.</p>

                    <li><strong>Execute:</strong></li>
                    <p>With the instruction decoded, the microprocessor performs the actual operation or manipulates the
                        data according to the instruction's requirements. This step completes the execution cycle, and
                        the result may be stored back in memory or sent to other components for further processing.</p>

            <h2>Calculation of Addressable Memory Space</h2>
            <p>
                Addressable memory space refers to the range of memory locations that a computer system can uniquely
                identify and access. The calculation of addressable memory space involves determining the maximum number
                of unique addresses that can be generated by the system.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Key Factors in Addressable Memory Space Calculation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Address Bus Width:</strong> The number of lines in the address bus determines the maximum
                    number of unique addresses that can be represented. A wider address bus allows for a larger
                    addressable memory space.</li>
                <li><strong>Addressability:</strong> The unit of addressability, often expressed in bits, indicates the
                    smallest addressable storage unit. For example, if the addressability is 8 bits, each address points
                    to a byte of memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Formula:</strong> The addressable memory space (N) can be calculated using the formula N =
                    2<sup>(Address Bus Width)</sup>.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong>
                <br>
                If a computer system has a 16-bit address bus, the addressable memory space would be 2^16, resulting in
                64 kilobytes (KB) of addressable memory.

            <ul>
                <li>When an instruction is fetched from memory, it is stored in the instruction register (IR). The
                    instruction decoder then interprets this opcode to determine the operation to be performed.</li>
                <li>The instruction decoder communicates the operation details to the timing and control unit, which
                    generates the necessary control signals to execute the instructions.</li>
                <li>For arithmetic and logical operations, one operand is typically fetched from the accumulator (A),
                    while the other operand is fetched from a temporary register (Temp Register) by the Arithmetic Logic
                    Unit (ALU). The ALU processes this data, and the result is usually stored back in the accumulator,
                    affecting the status flags based on the ALU outcome.</li>
                <li>For example, consider the instruction ADI 45H. The opcode ADI is fetched into the instruction
                    register and decoded by the instruction decoder. Subsequently, the timing and control unit generates
                    a signal to fetch the next byte of the instruction, which in this case is the data value 45H. This
                    data is then loaded into the temporary register for processing by the ALU, and the result is stored
                    back in the accumulator.</li>
