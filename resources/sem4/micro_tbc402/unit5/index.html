        <h1>Microcontroller</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A microcontroller is a combination of two words: 'micro' and 'controller'. 'Micro' means small in size,
                as we measure sizes in micro, nano, etc. Here, 'micro' refers to a measurement unit. 'Controller' means
                a device that controls the operation of any system. Combining these two words, we can say that a
                microcontroller is a small device that controls the operation of a particular system. We can also say
                that a microcontroller is a microprocessor in which all peripheral devices are integrated. That's why we
                call a microcontroller a 'system on chip' or 'computer on chip'. When all systems, peripherals, and
                components are integrated into a single chip, we call it a microcontroller.</li>
            <li>Microcontrollers are used in many applications, especially in embedded systems, to perform specific
                tasks. For example, they are used in washing machines or microwave ovens to control the operation of
                these devices. In a microwave oven, a microcontroller is used to control the temperature.
                Microcontrollers are used to perform such specific tasks.</li>
            <li>A microcontroller performs a specific type of task, and we choose its peripherals according to that
                task.</li>
            <li>A microcontroller includes a CPU, ROM, RAM, timer, counter, oscillator circuit, analog-to-digital
                converter, digital-to-analog converter, serial I/O ports, interrupt logic, and other functional blocks.
                All these components are integrated into a single chip. Therefore, we can say that a microcontroller is
                a complete system. However, we choose peripherals according to the application. For example, the task of
                a washing machine is to wash clothes. Therefore, we will select all the components required for this
                task in a microcontroller. The same applies to a microwave oven.</li>
