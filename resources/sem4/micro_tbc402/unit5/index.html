        <h1>Microcontroller</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A microcontroller is a combination of two words: 'micro' and 'controller'. 'Micro' means small in size,
                as we measure sizes in micro, nano, etc. Here, 'micro' refers to a measurement unit. 'Controller' means
                a device that controls the operation of any system. Combining these two words, we can say that a
                microcontroller is a small device that controls the operation of a particular system. We can also say
                that a microcontroller is a microprocessor in which all peripheral devices are integrated. That's why we
                call a microcontroller a 'system on chip' or 'computer on chip'. When all systems, peripherals, and
                components are integrated into a single chip, we call it a microcontroller.</li>
            <li>Microcontrollers are used in many applications, especially in embedded systems, to perform specific
                tasks. For example, they are used in washing machines or microwave ovens to control the operation of
                these devices. In a microwave oven, a microcontroller is used to control the temperature.
                Microcontrollers are used to perform such specific tasks.</li>
            <li>A microcontroller performs a specific type of task, and we choose its peripherals according to that
                task.</li>
            <li>A microcontroller includes a CPU, ROM, RAM, timer, counter, oscillator circuit, analog-to-digital
                converter, digital-to-analog converter, serial I/O ports, interrupt logic, and other functional blocks.
                All these components are integrated into a single chip. Therefore, we can say that a microcontroller is
                a complete system. However, we choose peripherals according to the application. For example, the task of
                a washing machine is to wash clothes. Therefore, we will select all the components required for this
                task in a microcontroller. The same applies to a microwave oven.</li>

            <h2>8051 Microcontroller: Introduction and History</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1981, Intel introduced an 8-bit microcontroller called the 8051. An 8-bit microcontroller means
                    it can process 8 bits of data at a time. <ul>
                        <li>The 8051 microcontroller was a revolutionary product at the
                            time of its release. Its introduction marked a significant milestone in the field of
                            embedded
                            systems, providing a compact and efficient solution for controlling electronic devices.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It was referred to as a system on a chip because it had a CPU, RAM, on-chip ROM, timers, counters,
                    and serial I/O ports all on a single chip.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The term "system on a chip" (SoC) is used because the
                            8051 integrates multiple components that are typically found in a computer system, all onto
                            a single
                            chip. This includes the central processing unit (CPU) for processing data, random-access
                            memory
                            (RAM) for temporary data storage, read-only memory (ROM) for permanent data storage, timers
                            and
                            counters for managing time-related operations, and serial input/output ports for
                            communication.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> NMOS (N-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology was initially
                    used to manufacture 8051 microcontrollers because it offered high-speed performance. However, NMOS
                    technology consumes more power, which is not ideal for battery-powered devices. To address this, the
                    industry shifted to using CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology, which is more
                    energy-efficient and extends the battery life of portable devices.
                </li>
                <li>It is widely used in embedded systems, consumer electronics, automotive systems, robotics, and
                    security cameras. <ul>
                        <li>The versatility and reliability of the 8051 microcontroller make it an ideal
                            choice for a wide range of applications. In embedded systems, it provides precise control
                            over
                            various electronic devices. In consumer electronics, it helps manage functions in devices
                            like
                            washing machines and microwave ovens. In automotive systems, it is used for engine control,
                            and in
                            robotics, it provides control over robotic movements. Security cameras use 8051
                            microcontrollers for
                            image processing and data handling.
                        </li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>The peripherals are integrated into a single chip, making the overall system cost very low. By
                integrating all necessary components into a single chip, the 8051 microcontroller reduces the need
                for additional external components. This integration not only lowers the overall cost of the system
                but also simplifies the design and manufacturing process.
            </li>
            <li>The size of the product is small compared to microprocessor-based systems, making it very handy.

                <ul>
                    <li>Microcontroller-based systems, such as those using the 8051, are compact in size because they
                        consolidate multiple functions onto a single chip. This compactness makes the devices easier to
                        handle and integrate into various products.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Microcontroller-based systems are more reliable. Due to their integrated design,
                microcontroller-based systems have fewer points of failure compared to systems that rely on multiple
                separate components. This reliability makes them suitable for critical applications where consistent
                performance is essential.
            </li>
            <li>Microcontroller-based systems are easy to maintain. Since all the essential components are
                integrated onto a single chip, troubleshooting and repairing microcontroller-based systems is
                generally simpler and more straightforward than dealing with more complex systems that have many
                separate parts.
            </li>
            <li>All these features are available in a 40-pin IC. The 8051 microcontroller packs all of its powerful
                features into a small 40-pin integrated circuit (IC), making it a compact and efficient solution for
                various applications.

                    Package), among others. Each package type has different configurations, which refer to the spacing
                    between pins and the rows of pins. These configurations are standardized to ensure compatibility and
                    protection of the IC.</li>
                <li>The 8051 microcontroller, being a DIP IC, has 40 pins. These pins are essential for connecting the
                    microcontroller to other components in a circuit.</li>
                <li>The 8051 microcontroller features four 8-bit bidirectional I/O ports named Port 0, Port 1, Port 2,
                    and Port 3. Each port consists of 8 pins, and they function as bidirectional I/O ports, meaning they
                    can operate as both input and output ports. Let’s discuss the function of each pin:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Port 0 (P0.0 to P0.7):</b> Port 0 serves as an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port. It can also
                        function as a multiplexed address and data bus during external memory access.</li>
                    <li><b>Port 1 (P1.0 to P1.7):</b> Port 1 is an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port. Unlike Port 0, it does
                        not have any dual function, making it solely an I/O port.</li>
                    <li><b>Port 2 (P2.0 to P2.7):</b> Port 2 serves as an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port. It can also be
                        used as the higher-order address bus during external memory access, in combination with Port 0.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Port 3 (P3.0 to P3.7):</b> Port 3 is an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port with additional
                        functionalities. Each pin can be used for specific alternate functions like serial
                        communication, external interrupts, and timer/counter inputs.</li>
                    <li><b>Pin 9 (RST):</b> This pin is used to reset the microcontroller. A high signal on this pin for
                        at least two machine cycles will reset the microcontroller.</li>
                    <li><b>Pin 18 and 19 (XTAL1 and XTAL2):</b> These pins are connected to an external crystal
                        oscillator to provide the clock frequency for the microcontroller’s operation.</li>
                    <li><b>Pin 20 (GND):</b> This pin is connected to the ground of the power supply.</li>
                    <li><b>Pin 31 (EA/ VPP):</b> External Access enable pin. It should be connected to Vcc for internal
                        program memory access.</li>
                    <li><b>Pin 40 (Vcc):</b> This pin is connected to the positive supply voltage.</li>
                </ul>

            <img src="../../images/microcontroller3.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the core component of the 8051 microcontroller. It is connected
                    to an oscillator that connects to an external crystal between terminals XTAL1 and XTAL2. This
                    crystal has a frequency of 12 MHz. The entire circuit functions based on this frequency. The crystal
                    frequency provided is crucial for the microcontroller's operation as the CPU executes instructions
                    in sync with the clock.</li>
                <li>The CPU contains an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that executes instructions. Instructions are
                    processed sequentially in sync with the clock signal, and the ALU performs arithmetic and logical
                    operations required by the instructions.</li>
                <li>The CPU is also connected to an interrupt control unit. The 8051 microcontroller has a total of 5
                    interrupts: 2 external hardware interrupts and 3 software-generated interrupts. There are two
                    timers, Timer 0 and Timer 1, which can trigger interrupts when they overflow. Additionally, there is
                    one interrupt related to serial communication. The interrupt control unit manages the priority and
                    execution of these interrupts by the CPU.</li>
                <li>The 8051 microcontroller is based on the Harvard architecture, which means it has separate memory
                    spaces for program and data. The program memory is typically stored in ROM (Read-Only Memory), and
                    the data memory is stored in RAM (Random Access Memory).</li>
                <li>The microcontroller has 4KB of on-chip ROM, with an address range from 0000H to 0FFFH, to store the
                    program. It also has 128 bytes of on-chip RAM for data storage.</li>
                <li>For external interfacing, the 8051 has an 8-bit data bus and a 16-bit address bus. The bus control
                    unit handles the address and data lines. The microcontroller has four I/O ports (Port 0, Port 1,
                    Port 2, and Port 3) with multiple functionalities:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Port 0:</b> It serves as an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port and also as a multiplexed address
                        and data bus (AD0 to AD7) for external memory interfacing.</li>
                    <li><b>Port 1:</b> It is an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port without any additional functions.</li>
                    <li><b>Port 2:</b> It serves as an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port and also provides the higher-order
                        address bus (A8 to A15) for external memory interfacing.</li>
                    <li><b>Port 3:</b> It is an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port with additional functionalities:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Pin 3.0 (RXD):</b> Serial input (receive data)</li>
                            <li><b>Pin 3.1 (TXD):</b> Serial output (transmit data)</li>
                            <li><b>Pin 3.2 (INT0):</b> External interrupt 0</li>
                            <li><b>Pin 3.3 (INT1):</b> External interrupt 1</li>
                            <li><b>Pin 3.4 (T0):</b> Timer 0 external input</li>
                            <li><b>Pin 3.5 (T1):</b> Timer 1 external input</li>
                            <li><b>Pin 3.6 (WR):</b> External memory write strobe</li>
                            <li><b>Pin 3.7 (RD):</b> External memory read strobe</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Serial communication is supported via the serial port, which is integrated into Port 3. This port
                    handles both serial transmission (TXD) and reception (RXD).</li>
                <li>The 8051 microcontroller includes two 16-bit timers/counters (Timer 0 and Timer 1). These timers can
                    operate as counters when provided with an external clock input, and their inputs are also integrated
                    into Port 3.</li>
                <li>The 8051 microcontroller's complete structure includes the CPU, oscillator, interrupt control,
                    program memory (4KB ROM), data memory (128 bytes RAM), 4 I/O ports, and serial communication
                    support. The microcontroller can handle multiple functionalities through its ports and internal
                    units, making it versatile for various applications.</li>
