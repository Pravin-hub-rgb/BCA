            <ul>
                <li>
                    The 8085 microprocessor faced difficulties in terms of I/O interfacing capability due to limited
                    data and address buses. To address this issue and enhance the I/O capabilities, Intel introduced the
                    8255 IC, which significantly increased interfacing capacities.

                        The 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface is designed to increase the I/O interfacing
                        capability of microprocessors.

                        It has 24 I/O pins that can be grouped into three 8-bit parallel ports: Port A, Port B, and Port
                        C.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Port C can be used as individual bits or can be split into two 4-bit parts: C<sub>upper</sub>
                        (C<sub>7</sub> - C<sub>4</sub>) and C<sub>lower</sub> (C<sub>3</sub> - C<sub>0</sub>).

                        <strong>Interfacing Requirement:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The need for interfacing arises because of the difference in operating speeds between
                                the microprocessor and the peripherals. Microprocessors operate at high speeds, while
                                peripherals like keyboards, displays, and printers operate at comparatively lower
                                speeds.</li>
                            <li>The 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface helps manage this speed mismatch by providing
                                a buffer and control logic that allows the microprocessor to communicate efficiently
                                with the peripherals.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Port Connections:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Port A:</strong> This port can be configured as an 8-bit input or output port
                                and is connected to I/O devices that require higher data transfer rates or need to
                                handle 8-bit data simultaneously.</li>
                            <li><strong>Port B:</strong> Similar to Port A, Port B can also be configured as an 8-bit
                                input or output port, allowing it to interface with various I/O devices.</li>
                            <li><strong>Port C:</strong> This port can be split into two 4-bit ports (C<sub>upper</sub>
                                and C<sub>lower</sub>). It can be used for controlling individual bits or for
                                interfacing with devices that require less data transfer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Control Port:</strong> The control port is used by the microprocessor to
                                configure and control the operation of Ports A, B, and C. The microprocessor uses the
                                read (<u style="text-decoration: overline;">RD</u>), write (<u
                                    style="text-decoration: overline;">WR</u>), and chip select (<u

                            <li><strong>Data Bus Buffer:</strong> This part of the 8255 is connected to the system data
                                bus. It transfers data between the microprocessor and the 8255.</li>
                            <li><strong>Read/Write Control Logic:</strong> This section manages the read and write
                                operations between the microprocessor and the 8255. It generates the appropriate control
                                signals based on the input from the microprocessor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Group A and Group B Control:</strong> The control logic is divided into two
                                groups, A and B, each controlling one of the ports (A or B) and a portion of Port C.
                                This allows for flexible configuration of the ports.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ports (A, B, and C):</strong> These ports are connected to the I/O devices. The
                                configuration of these ports is managed by the control registers.</li>

                <li>
                    The 8254 is used to generate finite delays. It has three integrated counters, each with a capacity
                    of 16 bits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Why do we use the 8254?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The initial versions of Intel microprocessors, such as the 8085 and 8086, did not have an integrated
                    timer. Without a hardware timer, generating delays required executing software loops, which had two
                    main issues:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The microprocessor would be busy while executing the delay program, meaning it couldn't
                            perform other tasks simultaneously.</li>
                        <li>The accuracy of the timing would depend on the execution time of the instructions, which
                            could vary.</li>
                    </ol>
                    These issues are resolved by using the 8254 IC.

                <h3>Features of 8254 PIT IC</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The 8254 is designed to work with various microprocessors, including the 8085 and 8086.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The 8254 is used as a timer to generate hardware delays.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Difference between hardware delay and software delay:</strong> A hardware delay is
                        generated by a dedicated timer IC, allowing the microprocessor to perform other tasks during the
                        delay period. In contrast, a software delay requires the microprocessor to execute a delay
                        program, making it unavailable for other tasks during the delay.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The 8254 can be used as a real-time clock or as a square wave generator.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hardware delay is more useful than software delay because the microprocessor is not actively
                        involved in generating the delay. When the 8254 generates a delay, the microprocessor is free to
                        execute other programs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The 8254 has three independent 16-bit down counters.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Down Counter:</strong> A down counter starts from a specified value and counts down to
                        zero.
