            <li>Computer Graphics isn’t just about drawing lines and shapes — it's also about bringing visuals to life and standardizing how graphics are created across systems. In this unit, we focus on two exciting areas: Animation and GKS Standards.</li>
            <li>We begin with Animation, where you’ll explore the basics of how motion is created on screen. You’ll learn about the core principles of animation (like timing and squash & stretch), the different types of animations used in games, movies, and interfaces, and finally, the various animation systems — including scripting-based, procedural, representational, and stochastic systems, each with its own way of controlling how things move and behave.</li>
            <li>Next, we dive into the Graphical Kernel System (GKS) — one of the first standards for computer graphics. You’ll understand how GKS defines basic building blocks called primitives, like polylines, polymarkers, filled areas, and text. We’ll also look at how GKS handles workstations and metafiles, which allow graphics to be rendered across different platforms in a consistent way.</li>
