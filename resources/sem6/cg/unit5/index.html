    <ul>
      <li>Computer Graphics isn’t just about drawing lines and shapes — it's also about bringing visuals to life
        and standardizing how graphics are created across systems. In this unit, we focus on two exciting areas:
        Animation and GKS Standards.</li>
      <li>We begin with Animation, where you’ll explore the basics of how motion is created on screen. You’ll
        learn about the core principles of animation (like timing and squash & stretch), the different types of
        animations used in games, movies, and interfaces, and finally, the various animation systems — including
        scripting-based, procedural, representational, and stochastic systems, each with its own way of
        controlling how things move and behave.</li>
      <li>Next, we dive into the Graphical Kernel System (GKS) — one of the first standards for computer graphics.
        You’ll understand how GKS defines basic building blocks called primitives, like polylines, polymarkers,
        filled areas, and text. We’ll also look at how GKS handles workstations and metafiles, which allow
        graphics to be rendered across different platforms in a consistent way.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>ANIMATION</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Animation is a process of displaying still images in a rapid sequence to create the illusion of
          movement. In computer graphics, it involves programming or designing movement by
          manipulating images using various techniques.</li>
        <li>A person who creates animations is called animator.
          He use various computer technologies to capture the pictures and then
          to animate these in the desired sequence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example Of Animation</strong></p>
      <img src="../../images/animation1.png" alt="" class="wb">
      <img src="../../images/animation2.png" alt="" class="wb">
      <ul>
        <li>Animation includes all the visual changes on the screen of display devices these are: change of
          shape, size, color, structure, angle.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="in">
        <h3>Application of animation</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Education and Training:</strong> Animation is used in school, colleges and
            training centers for education purpose. Flight simulators for aircraft
            are also animation based.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Animation methods are now commonly used in
            making motion pictures, music videos and television shows, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Computer Aided Design (CAD):</strong> One of the best applications of
            computer animation is Computer Aided Design and is generally
            referred to as CAD. One of the earlier applications of CAD was
            automobile designing. But now almost all types of designing are
            done by using CAD application, and without animation, all these
            work can't be possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> This is one of the significant applications of computer
            animation. The most important advantage of an animated
            advertisement is that it takes very less space and capture people
            attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Animated Presentation is the most effective way to
            represent an idea. It is used to describe financial, statistical,
            mathematical, scientific & economic data.</li>

      <h2>GKS (Graphical Kernel System) - The Universal Drawing Language</h2>

      <div class="in">
        <h3>1. Why We Needed GKS</h3>
        <p>Back in the 1970s-80s, every computer brand had its own way of drawing graphics. This was like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Every printer speaking a different language</li>
          <li>Monitors understanding only their manufacturer's commands</li>
          <li>Programmers rewriting graphics code for each device</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The International Organization for Standardization (<strong>ISO</strong>) created <strong>GKS</strong> as an
          official standard (like how USB or PDF are standards today) so that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One program could work on all devices</li>
          <li>Graphics would look the same everywhere</li>
          <li>Developers could learn just one system</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="in">
        <h3>2. The GKS Toolbox (Primitives)</h3>
        <p>GKS gives programmers four basic tools that combine like LEGO to make complex images:</p>
        <img src="../../images/cg6.svg" alt="" class="wb">
      </div>

      <div class="in">
        <h3>3. Workstation Concept (The Magic Translator)</h3>
        <p>GKS's clever solution to the device problem:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A software layer that translates GKS commands to what each device understands
          </li>
          <li><strong>Like:</strong> A universal remote that works with all TV brands</li>
          <li><strong>Types:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Output:</strong> For screens/printers (showing graphics)</li>
              <li><strong>Input:</strong> For mice/keyboards (interacting with graphics)</li>
              <li><strong>Combined:</strong> Devices like touchscreens</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Practical benefit:</strong> Write code once → runs on any supported device</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="in">
        <h3>4. Metafiles (The Replay Function)</h3>
        <p>How GKS saves and shares drawings:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>What they are:</strong> Digital recordings of drawing commands</li>
          <li><strong>Like:</strong> Saving a list of "how to draw" instructions rather than a photo</li>
          <li><strong>Why better than images:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Can edit later (change colors, text)</li>
              <li>Smaller file size</li>
              <li>Perfect quality at any zoom level</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Practical use:</strong> Saving vector graphics (like company logos)</li>
        </ul>
