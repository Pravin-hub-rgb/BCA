        <ul>
            <li>When you're working with computer graphics, you're not just drawing shapes — you're controlling how
                those shapes move, rotate, resize, and appear in space. That’s where 2D and 3D transformations come in.
                These transformations help bring flat designs to life and add depth and realism to 3D scenes.</li>
            <li>We’ll start with 2D transformations, where you’ll learn the basics like translation, rotation, and
                scaling — the building blocks of motion and shape manipulation on a flat plane. Then we’ll move into
                composite transformations, which let you combine effects like reflection and shearing for more complex
                visual effects. You’ll also explore how these transformations work between different coordinate systems.
            </li>
            <li>Then we jump into the exciting world of 3D transformations. This is where we add a third dimension to
                everything — including parallel and perspective projections (which help mimic how our eyes see the
                world). You'll also learn how to identify which parts of 3D objects should be visible and how to hide
                the rest using hidden surface removal algorithms.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>2D Transformation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2D transformation</strong> refers to operations that change the position, size, orientation,
                    or shape of 2D objects in a two-dimensional plane (X-Y plane).</li>

                <li>These transformations are fundamental in computer graphics, animation, and geometric modeling.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul>

                <li>In practice, transformations are often represented using matrices, which allow multiple
                    transformations to be combined into a single matrix operation using matrix multiplication.</li>
