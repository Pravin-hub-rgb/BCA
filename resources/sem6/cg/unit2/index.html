            <h3>Point Representation</h3>

            <p>Imagine placing a dot on a piece of paper; this dot represents a
                point. But how do we describe where this point is? We use a <strong>coordinate system</strong> for that.
            </p>

            <p>A point is a fundamental element that represents a position in space. It does not have a size, shape, or
                any other property except its location.</p>

            <h3>2D Coordinate System</h3>
            <p>In a <strong>2D (two-dimensional) space</strong>, we use an <strong>X-axis</strong> (horizontal) and a
                <strong>Y-axis</strong> (vertical) to locate a point. A point is written as:
                <span class="ms">
                    \[
            P(x, y)
            \]
                </span>
            </p>

            

            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( P(3, 5) \) means the point is at <strong>x = 3</strong> and <strong>y = 5</strong>.</li>
                <li>\( P(-2, 4) \) means the point is <strong>2 units left</strong> and <strong>4 units up</strong>.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>In 2D graphics, every object you see; lines, shapes, images; is made up of points positioned at specific
                coordinates.</p>

            <h3>3D Coordinate System</h3>
            <p>Now, in <strong>3D (three-dimensional) space</strong>, we add another axis: the <strong>Z-axis</strong>,
                which represents depth. A 3D point is written as:
            <span class="ms">
                \[
            P(x, y, z)
            \]
            </span>
            </p>

            

            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( P(2, 3, 5) \) means the point is at \( x = 2 \), \( y = 3 \), and \( z = 5 \) (depth).</li>
                <li>\( P(-1, 4, -3) \) means it is <strong>left by 1 unit, up by 4 units, and back by 3 units.</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Just like in 2D, every 3D model you see in games or animations is made up of points connected in space.
            </p>


            <div class="in">
                <h3>Distance Between Two Points</h3>
                <p>How far is one point from another? We use the <strong>distance formula</strong> to find out.</p>

                <p>In 2D, for two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \):
                    <span class="ms">
                        \[
                d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
                \]
                    </span>
                </p>

                

                <p>Example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find the distance between \( (3, 4) \) and \( (6, 8) \):
                        <span class="ms">\[
                            d = \sqrt{(6 - 3)^2 + (8 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
                            \]</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                

                <p>In 3D, the formula expands to include the \( z \)-coordinate: <span class="ms">
                    \[
                d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
                \]

                </span></p>

                
                <p>Distance is important in graphics for detecting collisions, measuring object placement, and
                    determining movement.</p>

                <!-- <h3>Midpoint Formula</h3>
                <p>Sometimes, we need to find the middle point between two given points. This is done using the
                    <strong>midpoint formula</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>In 2D, for two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \), the midpoint is:</p>

                \[
                M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
                \]

                <p>Example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find the midpoint between \( (2, 6) \) and \( (8, 4) \):</li>
                </ul>

                \[
                M = \left( \frac{2 + 8}{2}, \frac{6 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{10}{2}, \frac{10}{2} \right) = (5, 5)
                \]

                <p>In 3D, we just add \( z \):</p>

                \[
                M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}, \frac{z_1 + z_2}{2} \right)
                \]

                <p>The midpoint helps in dividing objects, detecting symmetry, and creating smooth curves in graphics.

            <h2>Vector Representation</h2>

            <p>A vector is simply a quantity that has both <strong>magnitude
                    (size)</strong> and <strong>direction</strong>. Imagine an arrow; it has a length (magnitude) and it
                points somewhere (direction). That’s exactly how vectors work!</p>

            <p>In 2D space, a vector is usually represented as:

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            \mathbf{A} = (x, y)
            \]
            </span>
        And in 3D space, it’s:
        <span class="ms">
            \[
            \mathbf{A} = (x, y, z)
            \]
        </span>
    </p>

            <p>For example, a vector \( \mathbf{A} = (3, 4) \) means it moves <strong>3 units in the
                    x-direction</strong> and <strong>4
                    units in the y-direction</strong>.</p>

            <p>A vector is a fundamental element in computer graphics that represents direction and magnitude. It is
                commonly used for movement, transformations, and physics-based calculations.</p>

            <h3>Vector Addition</h3>

            <p>Adding two vectors means combining their effects. Imagine two forces pushing an object; one pushes
                forward, and one pushes sideways. The object moves in a diagonal direction, which is the result of
                adding the two vectors.</p>

            <p>Mathematically, if we have two vectors:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            \mathbf{A} = (x_1, y_1, z_1), \quad \mathbf{B} = (x_2, y_2, z_2)
            \]
            </span>

            <p>Their sum is:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2, z_1 + z_2)
            \]
            </span>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( \mathbf{A} = (3, 2, 5) \)</li>
                <li>\( \mathbf{B} = (1, 4, -2) \)</li>
            </ul>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = (3+1, 2+4, 5+(-2)) = (4, 6, 3)
            \]
            </span>

            <p>In computer graphics, vector addition is used to calculate object movement, camera transitions, and even
                lighting effects.</p>

            <h3>Vector Multiplication</h3>

            <p>Now, what happens when we multiply vectors? There are two ways to do this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiplying a vector by a number (scalar multiplication).</li>
                <li>Multiplying two vectors:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dot product</li>
                        <li>Cross product</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scalar Multiplication</h3>
            <p>When a vector is multiplied by a number (scalar), its direction stays the same, but its length changes.
            </p>

            <p>Mathematically, if we have a vector: <span class="ms">\[
                \mathbf{A} = (x, y, z)
                \]</span></p>

            

            <p>And we multiply it by a scalar \( k \): <br> <span class="ms">\[
                k \mathbf{A} = (k \cdot x, k \cdot y, k \cdot z)
                \]</span></p>

            

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( \mathbf{A} = (2, -3, 4) \)</li>
                <li>Multiply by \( k = 3 \): <br> <span class="ms">
                    \[
            3 \mathbf{A} = (3 \cdot 2, 3 \cdot (-3), 3 \cdot 4) = (6, -9, 12)
            \]
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            

            <p>In computer graphics, this is used for scaling objects. If you want to double an object’s size, you
                multiply its vectors by 2.</p>

            <p>Vectors help define movement, forces, and transformations in 2D and 3D space, making them essential for
                animations, physics simulations, and rendering.</p>
            <h3>Scalar Product (Dot Product) of Two Vectors</h3>

            <p>Now that we know how to add and multiply vectors by a scalar, let’s talk about a special kind of vector
                multiplication: the <strong>dot product</strong>. This operation tells us how much two vectors are
                aligned in the same direction.</p>

            <p>Imagine you’re pushing a box. If you push in the same direction it moves, all your effort goes into
                moving it forward. But if you push at an angle, only part of your force moves the box forward. The dot
                product helps measure this effect mathematically.</p>

            <p>Mathematically, the dot product of two vectors \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) is:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 + z_1 z_2
            \]

            </span>
            <p>Or in another form: <span class="ms">\[
                \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = |\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}| \cos \theta
                \]</span></p>

            

            <p>where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( |\mathbf{A}| \) and \( |\mathbf{B}| \) are the magnitudes (lengths) of the vectors.</li>
                <li>\( \theta \) is the angle between them.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( \mathbf{A} = (2, 3, 1) \)</li>
                <li>\( \mathbf{B} = (4, -1, 2) \)</li>
            </ul>

            \[
            \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = (2 \cdot 4) + (3 \cdot -1) + (1 \cdot 2) = 8 - 3 + 2 = 7
            \]

            <p>If the dot product is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive</strong>: The vectors are pointing in a similar direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero</strong>: The vectors are perpendicular (90° apart).</li>
                <li><strong>Negative</strong>: The vectors are pointing in opposite directions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In computer graphics, the dot product is widely used for lighting effects, finding angles, and checking
                if objects are facing toward or away from a light source.</p>

            <p>The dot product of two vectors gives a measure of their similarity in direction. It is useful for
                calculating angles, lighting effects, and physics simulations.</p>

            <h3>Vector Product (Cross Product) of Two Vectors</h3>

            <p>Unlike the dot product, which gives a scalar (just a number), the <strong>cross product</strong> gives a
                new vector that is perpendicular to both original vectors. It’s super useful in 3D graphics and physics.
            </p>

            <p>Imagine you hold out your right hand: if your index finger points in one direction (vector A) and your
                middle finger points in another (vector B), your thumb will naturally point in a third direction; this is
                the cross product.</p>

            <p>Mathematically, for two vectors: <span class="ms">\[
                \mathbf{A} = (x_1, y_1, z_1), \quad \mathbf{B} = (x_2, y_2, z_2)
                \]</span></p>

            

            <p>Their cross product is:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} =
            \begin{vmatrix}
            \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
            x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\
            x_2 & y_2 & z_2
            \end{vmatrix}
            \]
            </span>

            <p>Expanding this determinant:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} =
            \left( y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2 \right) \mathbf{i} -
            \left( x_1 z_2 - z_1 x_2 \right) \mathbf{j} +
            \left( x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2 \right) \mathbf{k}
            \]
            </span>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( \mathbf{A} = (1, 2, 3) \)</li>
                <li>\( \mathbf{B} = (4, 5, 6) \)</li>

            <h3>Matrices and Operations Related to Matrices</h3>

            <p>You can think of a matrix as a table of numbers
                arranged in rows and columns. It’s like a spreadsheet or a grid where each number is placed in a
                specific position.</p>

            <p>In computer graphics, matrices are super important! They help with things like rotating, scaling, and
                moving objects in a 2D or 3D space.</p>

            <p>A matrix is usually represented as:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \dots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots
            & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \dots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            </span>

            <p>Here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( m \) is the number of rows</li>
                <li>\( n \) is the number of columns</li>
                <li>\( a_{ij} \) represents the element at row \( i \) and column \( j \)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For example, this is a <strong>2×3 matrix</strong> (2 rows, 3 columns):</p>

            <span class="ms">\[
                B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
                \]</span>

            <p>Matrices are used in computer graphics for transformations like rotation, scaling, and translation.</p>

            <h3>Matrix Addition and Subtraction</h3>

            <p>Adding or subtracting matrices is pretty simple! You just add or subtract corresponding elements.</p>

            <p>For two matrices:</p>

            <span class="ms">\[
                A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}, \quad
                B = \begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} \end{bmatrix}
                \]</span>

            <p>Their sum is:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            A + B = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} + b_{11} & a_{12} + b_{12} \\ a_{21} + b_{21} & a_{22} + b_{22} \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            </span>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 \end{bmatrix} \)</li>
                <li>\( B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 6 \\ 7 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \)</li>
            </ul>

           <span class="ms"> \[
            A + B = \begin{bmatrix} 2+1 & 3+6 \\ 4+7 & 5+2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 9 \\ 11 & 7 \end{bmatrix}
            \]</span>

            <p>Similarly, for subtraction:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            A - B = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} - b_{11} & a_{12} - b_{12} \\ a_{21} - b_{21} & a_{22} - b_{22} \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            </span>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            A - B = \begin{bmatrix} 2-1 & 3-6 \\ 4-7 & 5-2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 \\ -3 & 3
            \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            </span>

            <p>Matrix addition and subtraction are useful in image processing, blending effects, and performing
                transformations in graphics.</p>

            <h3>Matrix Multiplication</h3>

            <p>Unlike addition and subtraction, multiplying matrices is a bit different. Instead of multiplying
                corresponding elements, we multiply rows by columns.</p>

            <p>If we have:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}, \quad
            B = \begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            </span>

            <p>Their product is:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            A \times B = \begin{bmatrix} (a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21}) & (a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22}) \\ (a_{21}b_{11}
            + a_{22}b_{21}) & (a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22}) \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            </span>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>\( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \)</li>
                <li>\( B = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix} \)</li>
            </ul>
<span class="ms">
            \[
            A \times B = \begin{bmatrix} (1 \times 5 + 2 \times 7) & (1 \times 6 + 2 \times 8) \\ (3 \times 5 + 4 \times
            7) & (3 \times 6 + 4 \times 8) \end{bmatrix}
            \]

            \[
            = \begin{bmatrix} (5 + 14) & (6 + 16) \\ (15 + 28) & (18 + 32) \end{bmatrix}
            \]

            \[
            = \begin{bmatrix} 19 & 22 \\ 43 & 50 \end{bmatrix}
            \]
        </span>
            <p><strong>Important rules of matrix multiplication:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can only multiply matrices if the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of
                    rows in the second matrix.</li>
                <li>Matrix multiplication is <strong>not commutative</strong>, meaning \( A \times B \neq B \times A \)
                    in most cases.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Matrix multiplication is widely used in computer graphics for transforming objects, applying 3D
                rotations, and handling perspective projections.</p>

            <p>In graphics programming, matrices are used for transformations like translation, rotation, scaling, and
                perspective projection.</p>

            <h3>Transpose of a Matrix</h3>

            <p>Let’s now move on to the <strong>transpose</strong> of a matrix. You can think of the transpose as
                flipping a matrix over its diagonal. In other words, the rows become columns, and the columns become
                rows.</p>

            <p>If we have a matrix \( A \), the transpose of \( A \), denoted as \( A^T \), is formed by swapping the
                rows with the columns.</p>

            <p>For example, for a matrix \( A \) as:</p>

           <span class="ms">
            \[
            A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
            \]
           </span>

            <p>The transpose \( A^T \) would be:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            A^T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 \\ 2 & 5 \\ 3 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            </span>

            <p><strong>Important points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of rows in the original matrix becomes the number of columns in the transposed matrix,
                    and vice versa.</li>
                <li>For a square matrix, the transpose doesn’t change the size (number of rows = number of columns), but
                    it flips the elements.</li>
                <li>For a matrix \( A \), if you transpose it twice, you get back the original matrix: \( (A^T)^T = A
                    \).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The transpose operation is useful in computer graphics when dealing with transformations, as well as when
                you need to switch between row-major and column-major data structures in matrices.</p>

            <h3>Determinant and Inverse of a Matrix</h3>

            <p>Now, let’s move on to the <strong>determinant</strong> and <strong>inverse</strong> of a matrix, which
                are key operations in linear algebra and essential in graphics and physics simulations.</p>

            <h3>Determinant of a Matrix</h3>

            <p>The <strong>determinant</strong> of a matrix is a special number that can be calculated from its
                elements. It provides important information about the matrix, such as whether the matrix is invertible
                or singular.</p>

            <p>If we have a 2×2 matrix:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            </span>

            <p>The determinant of \( A \), denoted \( \text{det}(A) \), is calculated as:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            \text{det}(A) = a_{11} \cdot a_{22} - a_{12} \cdot a_{21}
            \]
            </span>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 4 \\ 2 & 5 \end{bmatrix} \)</li>
            </ul>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            \text{det}(A) = (3 \cdot 5) - (4 \cdot 2) = 15 - 8 = 7
            \]
            </span>

            <p>If the determinant of a matrix is <strong>zero</strong>, the matrix is said to be
                <strong>singular</strong> and cannot be inverted. If the determinant is non-zero, the matrix is
                invertible.
            </p>

            <h3>Inverse of a Matrix</h3>

            <p>The <strong>inverse</strong> of a matrix is another matrix that, when multiplied with the original
                matrix, gives the identity matrix (a matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere). In other
                words, if \( A \) is a matrix, its inverse is denoted \( A^{-1} \), and it satisfies: <span class="ms">\[
                    A \times A^{-1} = I
                    \]</span></p>

            

            <p>For a 2×2 matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix} \), its inverse
                is given by:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \begin{bmatrix} a_{22} & -a_{12} \\ -a_{21} & a_{11} \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            </span>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 4 \\ 2 & 5 \end{bmatrix} \)</li>
                <li>We already know that \( \text{det}(A) = 7 \)</li>
            </ul>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            A^{-1} = \frac{1}{7} \begin{bmatrix} 5 & -4 \\ -2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{5}{7} &
            \frac{-4}{7} \\ \frac{-2}{7} & \frac{3}{7} \end{bmatrix}

             \[
             \text{det}(A) = 2 \begin{vmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 8 & 9 \end{vmatrix}
             - 3 \begin{vmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 7 & 9 \end{vmatrix}
             + 1 \begin{vmatrix} 4 & 5 \\ 7 & 8 \end{vmatrix}
             \]
             \[
             \text{det}(A) = 2(5 \cdot 9 - 6 \cdot 8) - 3(4 \cdot 9 - 6 \cdot 7) + 1(4 \cdot 8 - 5 \cdot 7)
             \]
             \[
             = 2(45 - 48) - 3(36 - 42) + 1(32 - 35)
             \]
             \[
             = 2(-3) - 3(-6) + 1(-3)
             \]
             \[
             = -6 + 18 - 3 = 9
             \]
            </span>
            <p>So, \( \text{det}(A) = 9 \).</p>

            <h2>Lines in Geometry</h2>

            <p>Let’s dive into lines! Lines are an essential concept in geometry and are used to represent relationships
                between points in space. In computer graphics, lines are used to create shapes, outlines, and paths for
                drawing objects. A line is defined by two points, and it extends infinitely in both directions. But when
                we talk about a **line segment**, it refers to a part of the line that has two specific endpoints.</p>

            <h3>Line Segment</h3>

            <p>A <strong>line segment</strong> is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct endpoints. Unlike a
                line, which extends infinitely, a line segment has a finite length.</p>

            <p>For example, if we have two points \( P(x_1, y_1) \) and \( Q(x_2, y_2) \), the line segment connecting
                these points is written as \( \overline{PQ} \).</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Let’s say we have the points \( P(1, 2) \) and \( Q(4, 6) \). The line segment
                between them is \( \overline{PQ} \), and it represents a finite distance between the two points.</p>

            <p>The length of a line segment can be calculated using the distance formula: <span class="ms">\[
                \text{Length of the segment} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
                \]</span></p>

            

            <p><strong>Example Calculation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Points: \( P(1, 2) \) and \( Q(4, 6) \)</li>
                <li>Length: \( \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The length of the line segment \( \overline{PQ} \) is 5 units. This is a very useful formula for
                determining distances between points on a 2D plane.</p>

            <h3>Slope of a Line</h3>

            <p>The <strong>slope</strong> of a line is a measure of its steepness or inclination. It describes how much
                the line rises or falls as you move along the x-axis. In simpler terms, it tells you how much y changes
                as x changes.</p>

            <p>If you have two points \( P(x_1, y_1) \) and \( Q(x_2, y_2) \), the slope \( m \) of the line passing
                through these points is given by the formula: <span class="ms">
                    \[
            m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
            \]
                </span></p>

            

            <p>This formula tells you how much the y-coordinate changes for a unit change in the x-coordinate. The
                greater the value of the slope, the steeper the line.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Let’s take points \( P(1, 2) \) and \( Q(4, 6) \).</li>
                <li>Slope: \( m = \frac{6 - 2}{4 - 1} = \frac{4}{3} \)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The slope of the line passing through \( P(1, 2) \) and \( Q(4, 6) \) is \( \frac{4}{3} \), which means
                that for every 3 units you move horizontally, the line rises 4 units vertically.</p>

            <p>The slope is also important in computer graphics for tasks like drawing lines with specific orientations
                or rotating objects.</p>

            <h3>Equation of a Line</h3>

            <p>The equation of a line can be written in various forms, but one common form is the <strong>slope-intercept
                form</strong>: <span class="ms">\[
                    y = mx + b
                    \]</span></p>

            

            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( m \) is the slope of the line</li>
                <li>\( b \) is the y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the y-axis)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using the slope \( m = \frac{4}{3} \) and the point \( P(1, 2) \), we can find the equation of the
                    line.</li>
                <li>Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 2 \) into the equation \( y = mx + b \):</li>
            </ul>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            2 = \frac{4}{3}(1) + b \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2 = \frac{4}{3} + b \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = 2 -
            \frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
            \]

            </span>
            <p>The equation of the line is: <span class="ms">\[
                y = \frac{4}{3}x + \frac{2}{3}
                \]
    </span></p>

            
            <p>This tells you that the line has a slope of \( \frac{4}{3} \) and crosses the y-axis at \( \frac{2}{3}
                \).</p>



            <p>Lines are fundamental in computer graphics for drawing shapes, paths, and handling object
                transformations. They play an essential role in geometric calculations, rendering, and graphical
                representations.</p>

            <h3>Parametric Equations of a Line (2D)</h3>

            <p>Now let’s dive into <strong>parametric equations of a line</strong> in 2D. A parametric equation gives us
                a way to describe a line using a variable (usually denoted as \( t \)) that represents the position on
                the line. This allows us to represent the line in a more flexible way compared to the traditional
                slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \).</p>

            <p>In parametric form, we describe both \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates in terms of a parameter \( t \). The
                parameter \( t \) changes, and as it does, it moves along the line. When \( t \) is different, we get
                different points along the line.</p>

            <h3>General Form of Parametric Equations in 2D</h3>

            <p>For a line passing through two points \( A(x_0, y_0) \) and \( B(x_1, y_1) \), the parametric equations
                are:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            x = x_0 + t \cdot (x_1 - x_0)
            \]
            \[
            y = y_0 + t \cdot (y_1 - y_0)
            \]
            </span>

            <p>Here, \( t \) is the parameter, and as it changes, the equations give the coordinates \( (x, y) \) of the
                points on the line between and beyond points \( A \) and \( B \). The values of \( t \) will give us the
                points that lie on the line.</p>

            <h3>Example 1:</h3>

            <p>Let’s say we have two points \( A(2, 3) \) and \( B(6, 7) \). We want to find the parametric equations of
                the line passing through these points.</p>

            <p>Using the general formula:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            x = 2 + t \cdot (6 - 2) = 2 + 4t
            \]
            \[
            y = 3 + t \cdot (7 - 3) = 3 + 4t
            \]
            </span>

            <p>So, the parametric equations for the line passing through \( A(2, 3) \) and \( B(6, 7) \) are:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            x = 2 + 4t
            \]
            \[
            y = 3 + 4t
            \]
            </span>

            <p>Now, let’s solve for some specific values of \( t \) to find points on the line.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>When \( t = 0 \), we get the point \( (x, y) = (2, 3) \), which is the point \( A \).</li>
                <li>When \( t = 1 \), we get \( x = 2 + 4(1) = 6 \) and \( y = 3 + 4(1) = 7 \), which is the point \( B
                    \).</li>
                <li>When \( t = 2 \), we get \( x = 2 + 4(2) = 10 \) and \( y = 3 + 4(2) = 11 \), which is another point
                    on the line.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So, for \( t = 0 \), we have the point \( A(2, 3) \), for \( t = 1 \), we have the point \( B(6, 7) \),
                and for \( t = 2 \), we have the point \( (10, 11) \), which is another point along the line.</p>

            <h3>Example 2:</h3>

            <p>Let’s try another example. Suppose we have the points \( P(1, 1) \) and \( Q(4, 4) \). Find the
                parametric equations for the line passing through these points.</p>

            <p>Using the formula:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            x = 1 + t \cdot (4 - 1) = 1 + 3t
            \]
            \[
            y = 1 + t \cdot (4 - 1) = 1 + 3t
            \]
            </span>

            <p>The parametric equations for the line are:</p>

            <span class="ms">
                \[
            x = 1 + 3t
            \]
            \[
            y = 1 + 3t
            \]
            </span>

            <p>Let’s find some points for different values of \( t \):</p>

            <ul>
                <li>When \( t = 0 \), \( (x, y) = (1, 1) \), which is point \( P \).</li>
                <li>When \( t = 1 \), \( (x, y) = (1 + 3(1), 1 + 3(1)) = (4, 4) \), which is point \( Q \).</li>
                <li>When \( t = -1 \), \( (x, y) = (1 + 3(-1), 1 + 3(-1)) = (-2, -2) \), which is another point on the
                    line.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So, for \( t = 0 \), the point is \( (1, 1) \), for \( t = 1 \), the point is \( (4, 4) \), and for \( t
                = -1 \), the point is \( (-2, -2) \). As you can see, the line can be traced by adjusting \( t \) and
                finding the corresponding points.</p>

            <h3>Why Use Parametric Equations?</h3>

            <p>Parametric equations are particularly useful because they allow us to describe lines in a way that makes
                it easy to calculate positions over time, animate objects along paths, and perform geometric
                transformations. It’s a flexible approach that works well in both 2D and 3D space.</p>

            <p>Parametric equations provide a clear and efficient way to represent lines. By using a parameter \( t \),
                we can generate the coordinates of any point on the line between or beyond the given points. It’s very
                useful in computer graphics, motion simulations, and geometric calculations!</p>

            <h3>Parametric Equations of Conics (Circles, Ellipses, Parabolas, Hyperbolas)</h3>

            <p>Now let's explore <strong>parametric equations of conics</strong>. Conics are curves formed by the
                intersection of a plane and a cone. There are four basic types of conic sections: circles, ellipses,
                parabolas, and hyperbolas. These curves can be described using parametric equations, which provide a way
                to express the coordinates of points on the conic curve using a parameter (usually \( t \)).</p>

            <p>Each conic has its own unique parametric form, and we’ll look at how we can express them mathematically.
                Understanding parametric equations for conics is important in fields like computer graphics, physics,
                and engineering, as they are often used to represent curves and shapes.</p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Parametric Equations of a Circle</h3>

                <p>Let’s start with a <strong>circle</strong>. A circle is defined by its center \( (h, k) \) and its
                    radius
                    \( r \). The parametric equations for a circle are derived from the basic equation of a circle \( (x
                    -
                    h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), where \( (h, k) \) is the center and \( r \) is the radius.</p>

                <p>The parametric equations for a circle with center \( (h, k) \) and radius \( r \) are:</p>

                <span class="ms">
                    \[
                x = h + r \cdot \cos(t)
                \]
                \[
                y = k + r \cdot \sin(t)
                \]
                </span>

                <p>Here, \( t \) is the parameter, usually varying from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \), and as \( t \) changes,
                    the
                    coordinates \( (x, y) \) trace the points on the circle.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Let’s say we have a circle with center \( (0, 0) \) and radius \( 5 \). The
                    parametric equations would be:</p>

                <span class="ms">
                    \[
                x = 0 + 5 \cdot \cos(t) = 5 \cdot \cos(t)
                \]
                \[
                y = 0 + 5 \cdot \sin(t) = 5 \cdot \sin(t)
                \]
                </span>

                <p>As \( t \) varies from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \), the coordinates \( (x, y) \) trace out the circle.</p>

                <h3>Parametric Equations of an Ellipse</h3>

                <p>An <strong>ellipse</strong> is similar to a stretched or squished circle. It is defined by its center
                    \(
                    (h, k) \), its semi-major axis \( a \) (the longest radius), and its semi-minor axis \( b \) (the

                y = k + b \cdot \sin(t)
                \]
                </span>

                <p>Here, \( t \) is the parameter that varies from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \), and as \( t \) changes, the
                    points

                <h3>Parametric Equations of a Parabola</h3>

                <p>A <strong>parabola</strong> is a curve that is symmetric and U-shaped. The general equation of a
                    parabola
                    is \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), but we can express it parametrically. For a parabola with the vertex at
                    \(
                    (h, k) \), opening upwards or downwards, the parametric equations are:</p>

                <span class="ms">
                    \[
                x = t
                \]
                \[
                y = a(t - h)^2 + k
                \]
                </span>

                <p>Here, \( t \) is the parameter that represents the x-coordinate, and as \( t \) changes, the
                    y-coordinate
                    is calculated according to the equation. For a parabola opening upwards, \( a > 0 \), and for a
                    parabola
                    opening downwards, \( a < 0 \).</p>

                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Let’s take a parabola with vertex at \( (0, 0) \) and opening
                            upwards
                            with \( a = 1 \). The parametric equations would be:</p>

                        <span class="ms">
                            \[
                        x = t
                        \]
                        \[
                        y = t^2
                        \]

                        <p>As \( t \) changes, the points \( (x, y) \) trace the parabola.</p>

                        <h3>Parametric Equations of a Hyperbola</h3>

                        <p>A <strong>hyperbola</strong> is a curve formed by two separate branches, and it has two foci.
                            The
                            general equation for a hyperbola is \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \), but we can
                            express it in parametric form. The parametric equations for a hyperbola are:</p>

                        <span class="ms">
                            \[
                        x = a \cdot \cosh(t)
                        \]
                        \[
                        y = b \cdot \sinh(t)
                        \]
                        </span>

                        <p>Here, \( t \) is the parameter, \( \cosh(t) \) and \( \sinh(t) \) are the hyperbolic cosine
                            and
                            sine functions, respectively, and as \( t \) changes, the points \( (x, y) \) trace out the
                            two
                            branches of the hyperbola.</p>

                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Let’s take a hyperbola with \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 2 \). The
                            parametric
                            equations would be:</p>

                        <span class="ms">\[
                            x = 3 \cdot \cosh(t)
                            \]
                            \[
                            y = 2 \cdot \sinh(t)
                            \]</span>

                        <p>As \( t \) changes, the coordinates \( (x, y) \) trace the hyperbola.</p>

            <h3>Why Use Parametric Equations for Conics?</h3>

            <p>Parametric equations are extremely useful because they allow us to easily describe and
                manipulate
                conic curves. For example, in computer graphics and animation, we can animate objects moving
                along these curves or design paths based on conics. The parameter \( t \) provides
                flexibility
                to adjust the movement, speed, and direction along the curve.</p>

            <p> Parametric equations give us a powerful tool for representing conics like circles, ellipses,
                parabolas, and hyperbolas. These equations provide an elegant and simple way to describe
                complex
                curves, making them essential in various fields such as graphics, physics, and engineering.
