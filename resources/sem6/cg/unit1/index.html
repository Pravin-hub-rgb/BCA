        <h1>Intro to Computer Graphics</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Computer Graphics is all about creating, manipulating, and displaying images using computers. In simple
                words, it deals with generating visuals; whether it's the images you see in video games, the UI of apps,
                3D animations in movies, or even the graphs and charts in reports.</li>
            <li>It’s a field that blends mathematics, programming, and design to create visual content. The main goal is
                to make computers generate images efficiently and allow users to interact with them in meaningful ways.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Common Uses of Computer Graphics</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Entertainment:</b> Used in movies, animations, and video games to create realistic graphics
                        and special effects.</li>
                    <li><b>Education & Training:</b> Helps in simulations for medical training, flight simulators, and
                        interactive learning apps.</li>
                    <li><b>Scientific Visualization:</b> Used to represent complex data, such as weather models, medical
                        imaging (MRI, CT scans), and engineering designs.</li>
                    <li><b>Architecture & Design:</b> Enables 3D modeling for buildings, interior design, and urban
                        planning.</li>
                    <li><b>UI/UX Design:</b> Enhances user interfaces in websites, mobile apps, and software, making
                        them more intuitive.</li>
                    <li><b>Advertising & Marketing:</b> Used in digital posters, product visualizations, and animated
                        commercials.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How Images are Formed in Computer Graphics?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In computer graphics, images are displayed using tiny square units called pixels, arranged in a
                        grid.</li>
                    <li>By controlling the color and brightness of each pixel, we can create detailed pictures and
                        graphics.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Converting Shapes into Pixels</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>When a computer needs to display a shape, it must determine which pixels will best represent it
                        on
                        the screen.</li>
                    <li>This process of converting shapes into a set of pixels is called <b>Rasterization</b>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Displaying Continuous Images on Screens</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Real-world images and objects have smooth curves and edges, but digital screens are made up of
                        individual pixels.</li>
                    <li>To display continuous images on a screen, they must be broken down into discrete pixels.</li>
                    <li>This process is known as <b>Scan Conversion</b>, and it helps display curves and lines as
                        accurately
                        as possible.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advantages of Computer Graphics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Easy Communication with Visuals</b> - Computer graphics allow us to communicate with a computer using
                <b>visuals</b> instead of just text or numbers. This makes interactions much more intuitive and easier
                to understand.
            </li>
            <li><b>Creation of Real-World and Imaginary Objects</b> - With computer graphics, we can create both
                <b>real-world images</b> (like photos and 3D models) and <b>imaginary objects</b> (like mathematical
                shapes or data visualizations that don't physically exist).
            </li>
            <li><b>Animation and Moving Pictures</b> - One of the coolest things about computer graphics is that it can
                produce <b>moving pictures</b>, making animations possible. This allows us to create dynamic visuals
                that tell a story or explain concepts.</li>
            <li><b>Control Over Animations</b> - Computer graphics give us full control over animations. We can
                <b>adjust the speed</b>, zoom in or out, and decide how much detail to show, making the animation
                exactly how we want it.
            </li>
            <li><b>Motion Dynamics</b> - This feature lets us move objects or change viewpoints in real time. It’s great
                for creating interactive experiences.
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, have you ever taken a virtual tour of a house before buying it? That’s motion
                        dynamics in action!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Update Dynamics</b> - With update dynamics, we can change an object’s <b>shape</b>, <b>color</b>, or
                other properties whenever needed. This flexibility allows us to adapt objects in a scene to fit our
                needs or create different effects.</li>
            <li><b>Audio Feedback</b> - Thanks to advancements in digital sound processing, computer graphics now
                include <b>audio feedback</b>. This means we can add sound to the visuals, making the experience richer
                and more immersive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications of Computer Graphics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>User Interface:</b> One of the most useful applications of computer graphics is the <b>visual
                    objects</b> on the screen that help us interact with the computer. These are the buttons, icons, and
                menus we click or touch, making it easier for us to use software.</li>
            <li><b>Plotting Graphics and Charts:</b> Computer graphics are used to draw graphs like <b>bars, pie charts,
                    and histograms</b>. These are super helpful in business, government, and educational organizations
                for making quick and informed decisions.</li>
            <li><b>Office Automation and Desktop Publishing:</b> Graphics help in creating and sharing documents with
                text, tables, graphs, and even scanned or drawn images. It makes office work smoother and helps in
                <b>printing documents</b> efficiently.
            </li>
            <li><b>Computer-Aided Drafting and Design (CAD):</b> Graphics are used to design everything from
                <b>automobile bodies</b> to <b>building structures</b>. It allows for accurate modeling of components
                and systems before they are built.
            </li>
            <li><b>Simulation and Animation:</b> Computer graphics make <b>mathematical models</b> and mechanical
                systems more realistic and easy to study. It’s widely used in simulations to understand complex systems
                better.</li>
            <li><b>Art and Commerce:</b> Graphics tools are used by artists and advertisers to create <b>animated</b>
                and eye-catching images for promotions and campaigns.</li>
            <li><b>Process Control:</b> In modern systems, automation is often graphically displayed on the screen,
                helping control processes easily and effectively.</li>
            <li><b>Cartography:</b> Graphics are used to create and display maps—such as <b>geographic maps</b>,
                <b>weather maps</b>, and <b>oceanographic charts</b>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Education and Training:</b> Computer graphics are used to create <b>models</b> of physical,
                financial, and economic systems. These models can be helpful educational tools to understand complex
                concepts.</li>
            <li><b>Image Processing:</b> Graphics help in processing images, such as adjusting their <b>properties</b>
                (like brightness, contrast, or resolution) to enhance or modify them for specific purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Computer Graphics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>NICG (Non-Interactive Computer Graphics):</b> This type of computer graphics involves visuals that
                are already created and you just watch them. You can't change or interact with them. It's like the
                graphics are passive because they stay the same, no matter what you do.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: Things like <b>screen savers</b> or movies, where the visuals are played for you to
                        watch, but you don’t get to click, drag, or do anything to change them. It's all about just
                        viewing the content as it is.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>ICG (Interactive Computer Graphics):</b> Unlike NICG, this type of graphics lets you interact with
                and control what’s happening. You can change things in real-time, like moving objects around, clicking
                on things, or even changing the entire scene based on your actions.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: Think of things like <b>video games</b>, where you control the character’s movements,
                        or <b>virtual reality</b>, where you can explore a whole new world and change things as you go.
                        You can also find this in design software, where you can edit and move things around.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>How NICG and ICG Are Different:</b> In NICG, everything is pre-made and you just watch it, like a
                movie or screen saver. You can’t interact with it or change anything. But in ICG, you have control over
                what happens. You can click, move things, and interact with the graphics as they happen in real time.
                So, NICG is for passive viewing, and ICG is for an active, hands-on experience.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Basic Terminology</h2>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Understanding Pixels: The Basics and Color Representation</h3>
                <p>We see images on our screens every day; whether it's on our phones, computers, or TVs. But have you
                    ever wondered what actually makes up these images? The answer lies in something called pixels. Let's
                    break it down in a simple and detailed way.</p>
                <h3>What is a Pixel?</h3>
                <p>A pixel (short for picture element) is the smallest unit of a digital image. Think of it as a tiny
                    square or dot of color that, when combined with millions of other pixels, forms a complete image.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you zoom in on a digital image, you'll eventually see a grid of tiny colored squares.</li>
                    <li>Each square is a pixel, and it has a specific color and brightness.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Are Pixels Important?</h3>
                <p>Everything we see on a screen is made up of pixels. Whether you're watching a movie, playing a game,
                    or editing a photo, the quality and clarity of what you see depend on how many pixels are there and
                    how they are arranged.</p>

                <h3>The Components of a Pixel: RGB Color Model</h3>
                <p>Each pixel in a digital screen isn’t just a single solid color. Instead, it is made up of three
                    sub-pixels that emit different amounts of Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B) light.</p>
                <p>This is called the <strong>RGB (Red, Green, Blue) Color Model</strong> because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Red (R)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Green (G)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Blue (B)</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>By adjusting the brightness of these three colors, we can create millions of different colors.</p>

                <h3>Understanding Bit Depth and Color Representation</h3>
                <p>To store and display colors, each of the three RGB components has a certain bit depth, which
                    determines how many different shades each color can have.</p>

                <h3>Bit Depth Explained</h3>
                <p>Each color channel (Red, Green, and Blue) is assigned a certain number of bits. The most common is
                    <strong>8-bit per channel</strong>, meaning each color can have 256 different shades (ranging from 0
                    to 255).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>0</strong> means no intensity (black).</li>
                    <li><strong>255</strong> means full intensity (brightest).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since a pixel has three color channels (RGB), the total number of possible colors in an 8-bit system
                    is:</p>
                <p><strong>256×256×256 = 16,777,216</strong> (around 16.7 million colors)</p>
                <p>This is called <strong>24-bit color depth</strong> because each pixel is made up of 8 bits per
                    channel (8 Red + 8 Green + 8 Blue = 24 bits).</p>

                <h3>Other Bit Depths:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1-bit (Black & White only)</strong> → 2 colors</li>
                    <li><strong>8-bit (Grayscale or indexed color)</strong> → 256 colors</li>
                    <li><strong>16-bit (High color)</strong> → 65,536 colors</li>
                    <li><strong>24-bit (True color, used in most displays)</strong> → 16.7 million colors</li>
                    <li><strong>32-bit (Includes alpha for transparency effects)</strong> → Same as 24-bit but with an
                        extra 8-bit alpha channel for transparency.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How RGB Values Create Colors</h3>
                <p>By mixing different intensities of R, G, and B, we can create a variety of colors.</p>

                <h3>Some common RGB combinations:</h3>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Color</th>
                        <th>Red (R)</th>
                        <th>Green (G)</th>

                <h3>Image Resolution and Pixel Density</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Now that we have a solid understanding of pixels, let’s explore two fundamental concepts that
                        directly impact the quality of an image: Image Resolution and Pixel Density (PPI - Pixels Per
                        Inch). These two factors determine how sharp, detailed, and clear an image appears on a screen
                        or in print.</li>
                    <li>If you've ever wondered why a 4K display looks so much sharper than a 1080p screen or why some
                        printed images appear blurry while others look crisp, understanding resolution and pixel density
                        will make things much clearer!</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Image Resolution: The Total Number of Pixels in an Image</h3>

                <p><strong>What is Image Resolution?</strong></p>
                <p>Resolution refers to the total number of pixels that make up an image. It’s typically expressed as
                    Width × Height in pixels.</p>

                <p>For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1920 × 1080 (Full HD)</strong> → 2,073,600 pixels (about 2.07 megapixels)</li>
                    <li><strong>3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)</strong> → 8,294,400 pixels (about 8.29 megapixels)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The higher the resolution, the more pixels are used to display the image, which means more details
                    and a clearer picture.</p>

                <p><strong>Why Does Higher Resolution Look Better?</strong></p>
                <p>Let’s think of an image as a mosaic. Imagine you’re creating a painting using small colored tiles.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have fewer tiles (low resolution) → the image looks blocky and less detailed.</li>
                    <li>If you have more tiles (high resolution) → the image is smoother and has finer details.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is exactly how digital images work! More pixels = more detail.</p>

                <p><strong>Types of Image Resolution</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Screen Resolution (For Digital Displays)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The number of pixels that a display can show.</li>
                            <li>Examples: 720p (1280 × 720), 1080p (1920 × 1080), 4K (3840 × 2160), 8K (7680 × 4320).
                            </li>
                            <li>Affects image clarity, sharpness, and detail on screens.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Print Resolution (For Physical Prints)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Printed images are measured in DPI (Dots Per Inch) instead of pixels.</li>
                            <li>A 300 DPI print is considered high quality for photos.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Camera Resolution (Megapixels in Cameras)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The total number of pixels in an image captured by a camera.</li>
                            <li>Example: A 12 MP (megapixel) camera captures images with about 12 million pixels.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>How Resolution Affects Image Quality</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>720p (1280×720)</strong> - Used in low-end monitors, budget phones. Looks decent, but
                        lacks fine detail.</li>
                    <li><strong>1080p (1920×1080)</strong> - Found in most laptops, monitors, and TVs. Clear and sharp
                        for most users.</li>
                    <li><strong>4K (3840×2160)</strong> - Common in high-end monitors, gaming, and TV screens. Extremely
                        sharp and detailed.</li>
                    <li><strong>8K (7680×4320)</strong> - Used in professional displays and high-end TVs. Overkill for
                        most users.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example: Calculating the Storage Required for an Image</strong></p>
                <p>Let’s take an image with a resolution of <strong>1000 × 750 pixels</strong>.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1: Find the Total Number of Pixels</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>1000 × 750 = 750,000 pixels</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>This means the image is made up of 750,000 tiny colored squares.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><strong>Step 2: Find the Total Storage Required</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Now, let’s assume <strong>24-bit color depth (8 bits per channel)</strong>:</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>750,000 × 24 bits per pixel = 18,000,000 bits</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Since <strong>8 bits = 1 byte</strong>, we divide by 8:</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>18,000,000 ÷ 8 = 2,250,000 bytes</strong></p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><strong>Step 3: Convert Bytes to Kilobytes (KB)</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>To convert bytes to kilobytes, divide by <strong>1024</strong>:</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>2,250,000 bytes ÷ 1024 = 2,199.22 KB</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>This means the image takes up about <strong>2,199.22 KB</strong> of storage.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><strong>Step 4: Convert Kilobytes to Megabytes (MB)</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>If you want the size in megabytes, you divide by <strong>1024</strong> again:</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>2,199.22 KB ÷ 1024 = 2.15 MB</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>So, this image (1000 × 750 pixels, 24-bit color) will take up about <strong>2.15
                                    MB</strong> of storage.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The total storage required for the image is approximately <strong>2.15
                        MB</strong> (or <strong>2,199.22 KB</strong>).</p>


                <h3>Pixel Density (PPI - Pixels Per Inch)</h3>

                <p><strong>What is Pixel Density?</strong></p>
                <p>While resolution tells us how many pixels an image has, <strong>Pixel Density (PPI)</strong> tells us
                    how tightly packed those pixels are within a given space.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Higher PPI = Sharper image</li>
                    <li>Lower PPI = More pixelated image</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>How PPI Works</strong></p>
                <p>Think of pixel density like a grid of dots on a piece of paper:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you squeeze a lot of dots into a small space → the image looks smooth and detailed.</li>
                    <li>If the dots are spread out too much → the image looks pixelated.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Pixel Density in Different Devices</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard Monitor</strong> - Example Resolution: 1920 × 1080, Screen Size: 24 inches, PPI
                        Approx: 92</li>
                    <li><strong>Retina Display (MacBook)</strong> - Example Resolution: 2560 × 1600, Screen Size: 13
                        inches, PPI Approx: 227</li>
                    <li><strong>Smartphone Display</strong> - Example Resolution: 2400 × 1080, Screen Size: 6 inches,
                        PPI Approx: 400+</li>
                    <li><strong>4K TV</strong> - Example Resolution: 3840 × 2160, Screen Size: 55 inches, PPI Approx: 80
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why Does PPI Matter?</strong></p>

                <p>If you’ve ever compared an iPhone screen to a laptop screen, you might have noticed that text and
                    images look much sharper on the phone. This is because phones have very high PPI, while laptops and
                    monitors have a lower PPI.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low PPI (&lt;100 PPI)</strong> - Can look pixelated when viewed up close.</li>
                    <li><strong>High PPI (&gt;300 PPI)</strong> - Crisp, detailed images. Common in smartphones,
                        high-end laptops, and tablets.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>How to Calculate PPI?</strong></p>

                <p>To calculate PPI, we use this formula:</p>

                <p><strong>PPI = Diagonal Resolution (in pixels) ÷ Screen Size (in inches)</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Example: Calculating PPI for a 1920 × 1080 resolution on a 24-inch monitor</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Find the diagonal resolution using the Pythagorean theorem:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(1920² + 1080²) = 3,686,400 + 1,166,400 = 4,852,800</li>
                        <li>√4,852,800 ≈ 2202</l>
                    </ul>
                </ul>



                <ul>
                    <li>Divide by screen size:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2202 ÷ 24 ≈ 92 PPI</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                

                <p>So, a <strong>24-inch Full HD monitor</strong> has about <strong>92 PPI</strong>.</p>

                <p><strong>For comparison:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>13-inch MacBook Pro</strong> - Resolution: 2560 × 1600, PPI Approx: 227</li>
                    <li><strong>6-inch Smartphone</strong> - Resolution: 2400 × 1080, PPI Approx: 400+</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Understanding Aspect Ratio in Depth</h3>
                <p>Aspect ratio plays a big role in how images, videos, and screens look. If you’ve ever seen a video
                    that looks stretched or has black bars on the sides, that’s because of aspect ratio differences.
                    Let’s break it down step by step.</p>

                <p><strong>What is Aspect Ratio?</strong></h3>

                <p>Aspect ratio is simply the proportional relationship between the width and height of an image or
                    screen. It’s written as:</p>

                <p><strong>Aspect Ratio = Width ÷ Height</strong></p>

                <p>For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1920 × 1080 resolution</strong> → 16:9 aspect ratio</li>
                    <li><strong>1280 × 720 resolution</strong> → 16:9 aspect ratio</li>
                    <li><strong>3840 × 2160 resolution</strong> → 16:9 aspect ratio</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why is Aspect Ratio Important?</strong></p>

                <p>Aspect ratio affects how content is displayed. If you try to display a 16:9 video on a 4:3 screen,
                    you’ll either:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Stretch the image, making it look distorted, or</li>
                    <li>Add black bars (<strong>letterboxing</strong> or <strong>pillarboxing</strong>) to maintain the
                        original aspect ratio.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>So, different aspect ratios are used for different purposes to optimize the viewing experience.</p>

                <p><strong>Common Aspect Ratios and Where They Are Used</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>4:3 (Standard TV/Old Monitors)</strong>

                <p><strong>The Shift from 4:3 to 16:9</strong></p>

                <p>Back in the early 2000s, 4:3 aspect ratio was the standard for TVs and monitors. But as HD content
                    became more common, 16:9 widescreen format took over because it provided:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A more cinematic experience</li>
                    <li>Better fit for modern displays</li>
                    <li>More screen space for multitasking</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Today, 16:9 is the default for most screens, including laptops, TVs, and smartphones in landscape
                    mode.</p>

                <h3>3. How Aspect Ratio Affects Viewing Experience</h3>

                <h4>A. Watching Videos and Movies</h4>

                <p>Ever watched a movie and noticed black bars on the top and bottom? That happens when the movie's
                    aspect ratio is wider than the screen.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>16:9 video on a 16:9 screen</strong> → Perfect fit</li>
                    <li><strong>21:9 movie on a 16:9 screen</strong> → Black bars (<strong>letterboxing</strong>) appear
                        on top and bottom</li>
                    <li><strong>16:9 video on a 4:3 screen</strong> → Black bars (<strong>pillarboxing</strong>) appear
                        on the sides</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>B. Gaming and Productivity</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Ultrawide monitors (21:9) provide more horizontal screen space in games and work applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>32:9 monitors are like having two 16:9 screens side by side, great for multitasking.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>C. Social Media and Vertical Videos</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>9:16 aspect ratio (vertical) is used for platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and Snapchat
                        because people hold their phones vertically.</li>
                    <li>If you upload a 16:9 video on TikTok, it will appear with huge black bars or get cropped.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. How to Calculate Aspect Ratio</h3>

                <p>To find the aspect ratio of any resolution, simply divide width by height, then reduce it to its
                    simplest form.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> For 1920 × 1080
                        <ul>
                            <li>1920 ÷ 1080 = 1.777</li>
                            <li>Since 16 ÷ 9 = 1.777, the aspect ratio is <strong>16:9</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> For 2560 × 1080
                        <ul>
                            <li>2560 ÷ 1080 = 2.37</li>
                            <li>Since 21 ÷ 9 = 2.33, it's an approximate <strong>21:9</strong> aspect ratio.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Changing Aspect Ratio: Cropping vs. Stretching</h3>

                <p>If you have an image or video with a different aspect ratio than the display, you can adjust it in
                    different ways:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stretching</strong> → Fills the screen but makes everything look distorted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cropping</strong> → Cuts off parts of the image to fit the screen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Letterboxing/Pillarboxing</strong> → Adds black bars to maintain the original aspect
                        ratio.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>For the best results, always use content that matches your display’s native aspect ratio.</p>

                <h3>CMY Color Model</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The CMY color model is used in printing, and it works differently from how colors are created on
                        screens. While screens use the RGB color model, which creates colors by adding light, CMY works
                        by removing light. This is why it’s called a subtractive color model.</li>
                    <li>Imagine a white piece of paper. White reflects all the colors of light. When you print with ink,
                        the ink absorbs certain parts of the light, and only the remaining light is what you see.</li>
                    <li>In the CMY model, there are three primary colors of ink:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cyan (C)</li>
                            <li>Magenta (M)</li>
                            <li>Yellow (Y)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Each of these colors of ink removes a specific part of the light:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cyan absorbs red light.</li>
                            <li>Magenta absorbs green light.</li>
                            <li>Yellow absorbs blue light.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>By mixing these inks, printers can create a wide range of colors. When the cyan, magenta, and
                        yellow inks are used together, they ideally absorb all the colors of light and leave nothing to
                        reflect, which should create black. However, in practice, this mix results in a dark, muddy
                        color, which is why printers use black ink to improve the color quality.</li>
                    <li>The key takeaway from the CMY model is that it works by subtracting light. Instead of adding
                        colors like on a screen, the printer removes certain wavelengths (or parts) of light to create
                        the final color you see on the paper.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>CMYK Color Model (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The CMYK color model is an extension of the CMY model and is primarily used in printing. It
                        stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. While the CMY model works by removing light to
                        create colors, CMYK adds black ink to improve the color depth and quality of printed images.
                    </li>
                    <li>In the CMY model, mixing the three primary colors of cyan, magenta, and yellow ideally creates
                        black, but in reality, it results in a muddy dark brown. This is because mixing inks doesn’t
                        produce a true, deep black, which is why printers use an additional black (K) ink to get better
                        contrast and sharper details.</li>
                    <li>Why Add Black (K)?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Better depth and clarity: Using just cyan, magenta, and yellow often results in a faded
                                or dull black. Black ink is needed to create rich, true blacks and improve overall
                                contrast in printed images.</li>
                            <li>Cost and efficiency: Using a separate black ink cartridge is more economical than mixing
                                three colors to create black every time, saving on ink costs.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>How CMYK Works
                        <ul>
                            <li>In CMYK, each color of ink still works to absorb certain parts of the light:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Cyan (C) absorbs red light.</li>
                                    <li>Magenta (M) absorbs green light.</li>
                                    <li>Yellow (Y) absorbs blue light.</li>
                                    <li>Black (K) is used for the darkest areas and to sharpen details.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>When all four inks are used in combination, they create a full range of colors, allowing
                        printers to reproduce everything from bright colors to deep blacks with high quality.</li>
                    <li>The Process of Subtracting Light
                        <ul>
                            <li>Just like CMY, the CMYK model subtracts (removes) parts of light from a white surface
                                (paper) to form the desired color. The difference here is the use of black ink to make
                                the print look darker and more detailed, creating a richer color result than CMY alone.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The CMYK model is the standard in color printing because it combines three primary colors (cyan,
                        magenta, and yellow) with a separate black ink (K) to produce high-quality prints with
                        true-to-life colors.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) is an electronic display device used primarily in older televisions and
                        computer monitors. It works by firing electrons at a phosphor-coated screen, which lights up to
                        form an image. The CRT operates by manipulating the electron beam and using a series of
                        components to direct it onto the screen in such a way that it creates a full image.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The CRT’s base contains connector pins that connect the tube to external circuits. These
                                pins deliver power and control signals to the internal components, like the electron gun
                                and deflection system.</li>
                            <li>They serve as the interface between the CRT and the rest of the system, providing
                                necessary power and signals to function properly.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Cathode: A heated filament that emits electrons when heated.</li>

                                    <li>Anode: Attracts the negatively charged electrons and accelerates them toward the

                                    <li>The front of the CRT is coated with phosphor material that glows when hit by the
                                        electron beam. This screen is divided into red, green, and blue sections (RGB),
                                        allowing the creation of full-color images by controlling the intensity and
                                        duration of electron impacts.</li>
                                </ul>

                <p><strong>Working of a CRT</strong></p>
                <p>Now, let’s understand how all these components work together to display an image.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Electron Emission (Electron Gun)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The electron gun at the back of the CRT emits electrons. The cathode inside the gun
                                heats up, causing it to release electrons.</li>
                            <li>The control grid adjusts how many electrons can pass through to ensure the correct
                                brightness for the image.</li>
                            <li>The anode attracts the electrons and accelerates them toward the phosphor-coated screen.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Focusing the Electron Beam</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once the electrons are emitted, they need to be focused into a fine beam so that they
                                don’t spread out and blur the image. The focusing system directs the beam, ensuring it
                                stays tight and clear.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Deflecting the Electron Beam (Vertical and Horizontal)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The electron beam is directed across the screen in a raster pattern—starting at the
                                top-left corner and sweeping across to the right, then moving down to the next line.
                            </li>
                            <li>The vertical deflection system moves the beam up or down using electromagnetic coils or
                                deflection plates. The amount of voltage applied to these coils determines the vertical
                                position of the beam.</li>
                            <li>Similarly, the horizontal deflection system moves the beam left or right. It works in
                                synchronization with the vertical system to ensure the beam covers the entire screen.
                            </li>
                            <li>Both deflection systems allow the electron beam to cover the whole screen
                                systematically.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Phosphor Coating and Image Creation</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The phosphor-coated screen reacts when the electron beam hits it. The phosphor material
                                emits light in different colors (red, green, blue) depending on the section of the
                                screen the electron hits.</li>
                            <li>The screen is made up of millions of tiny phosphor dots or pixels, and each pixel
                                consists of subpixels for red, green, and blue colors.</li>
                            <li>The electron beam is directed to specific pixels, exciting the phosphor and making it
                                glow, which in turn creates part of the image.</li>
                            <li>By controlling the intensity and the location of the electron beam, a full-color image
                                is formed, pixel by pixel.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Image Refresh</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The CRT works by continuously refreshing the image many times per second. This happens
                                so quickly that our eyes perceive a stable image.</li>
                            <li>The scanning of the electron beam happens in a very fast, systematic pattern, creating
                                the illusion of a steady image.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Scanning Types in CRT</strong></p>
                <p>In a CRT, scanning refers to how the electron beam moves across the screen to create an image. There
                    are two main types of scanning:
                <ol>
                    <li>Raster Scan</li>
                    <li>Random Scan</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Raster Scan</strong></p>
                <p>Raster scan is the most common type of scanning used in televisions and monitors. In this method, the
                    electron beam systematically moves across the screen in a fixed pattern, covering the entire screen
                    line by line from top to bottom.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How It Works
                        <ul>
                            <li>The electron beam starts at the top-left corner of the screen.</li>
                            <li>It moves horizontally from left to right while turning pixels on or off to create part
                                of the image.</li>
                            <li>When it reaches the right edge, the beam quickly moves back to the left in a process
                                called horizontal retrace.</li>
                            <li>The beam then moves down to the next line and repeats the process.</li>
                            <li>After scanning all the lines, the beam reaches the bottom-right corner.</li>
                            <li>It then returns to the top-left corner in a process called vertical retrace and starts
                                scanning the next frame.</li>
                        </ul>
                        This process repeats many times per second to maintain a smooth and continuous image.
                    </li>
                    <li>Characteristics of Raster Scan
                        <ul>
                            <li>Used in TVs, monitors, and digital displays.</li>
                            <li>Covers the entire screen, whether the image needs it or not.</li>
                            <li>Requires a frame buffer, which stores the image before it is displayed.</li>
                            <li>Works well for detailed, complex images.</li>
                            <li>May experience flickering, which is reduced by increasing the refresh rate.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Example Applications
                        <ul>
                            <li>Televisions and computer monitors.</li>
                            <li>Video games and multimedia displays.</li>
                            <li>Digital image processing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Random Scan</strong></p>
                <p>Random scan, also known as vector scan or stroke writing, is different from raster scanning because
                    the electron beam moves only to the parts of the screen where drawing is required. It does not scan
                    the entire screen line by line.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How It Works
                        <ul>
                            <li>The beam directly moves from one point to another to draw the image.</li>
                            <li>Instead of scanning the whole screen, it only draws lines, curves, and shapes as needed.
                            </li>
                            <li>The beam moves in any order instead of a fixed top-to-bottom pattern.</li>
                            <li>The image is drawn by connecting points to form shapes, similar to how a pen plots
                                points on paper.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Does not require a frame buffer because only the necessary parts of the screen are
                                updated.</li>
                            <li>Not suitable for complex, detailed images because the beam must trace every line
                                individually.</li>
                        </ul>

                <p><strong>Comparison: Raster Scan vs. Random Scan</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How it works:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: The electron beam systematically moves line by line from top to bottom,
                                scanning the entire screen even if only a small portion of the image changes. Each pixel
                                on the screen is updated based on the image stored in the frame buffer.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: The electron beam directly moves to specific points on the screen where
                                drawing is required, instead of scanning the entire screen. It draws shapes like lines
                                and curves by moving from one coordinate to another, like a pen on paper.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Speed:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: Slower compared to random scan because the entire screen is redrawn
                                multiple times per second, even if some parts remain unchanged. The refresh rate
                                determines how often the screen is updated (e.g., 60Hz means 60 times per second).</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: Faster for line-based graphics because it only draws the necessary parts of
                                the image instead of scanning the whole screen. It does not need to continuously refresh
                                every pixel, making it more efficient for simple images.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Image Type:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: Best suited for detailed and complex images such as photographs, videos,
                                and realistic graphics. Since every pixel is individually updated, it can handle
                                high-resolution images smoothly.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: Works well for simple line drawings and geometric shapes. Since it does not
                                scan the entire screen, it is inefficient for complex images that require shading and
                                detailed textures.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Flickering:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: May experience flickering, especially at lower refresh rates. This happens
                                because the image needs to be continuously refreshed, and if the refresh rate is too
                                low, the human eye perceives noticeable flickers. Higher refresh rates (e.g., 120Hz)
                                reduce flickering.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: Produces minimal flicker since the electron beam directly draws the
                                necessary parts and does not rely on a full-screen refresh. This makes it more stable
                                for applications that require precision, such as scientific measurements and CAD
                                drawings.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: Widely used in TVs, computer monitors, gaming consoles, and multimedia
                                displays where full-screen graphics, colors, and animations are needed. All modern
                                digital screens use raster scanning to create smooth visuals.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: Mostly used in CAD (Computer-Aided Design) systems, oscilloscopes, and
                                radar displays where only wireframe graphics or simple geometric patterns are needed. It
                                was popular in early computer graphics systems before raster scanning became dominant.

                    <li>Fame Buffer Needed?:
                        <ol>
                            <li> Raster Scan: Yes, a frame buffer is required to store image data before it is
                                displayed. The frame buffer holds pixel information and refreshes the screen
                                continuously, ensuring smooth images.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: No, since the beam only moves to the required points, there is no need for
                                a frame buffer. The image is directly generated by controlling the beam’s movement,
                                reducing memory requirements.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li>Quick Working Difference:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: Think of this like how you read a book—line by line, from top to bottom.
                                The electron beam sweeps across the entire screen, updating every pixel whether it needs
                                to change or not. Even if only a small part of the image changes, the whole screen gets
                                refreshed again and again. This is how TVs, monitors, and modern displays work.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: Now, imagine drawing with a pen. Instead of covering everything, you only
                                move the pen where needed to create lines, curves, or shapes. That’s exactly how Random
                                Scan works—the electron beam jumps directly to the parts that need drawing instead of
                                scanning the whole screen. This makes it perfect for simple line drawings, like CAD
                                designs or radar screens.</li>
                        </ol>
                        So basically, Raster Scan is like a typewriter (covering everything line by line), while Random
                        Scan is like a pen (drawing only what’s needed).

                <h3>DVST (Direct View Storage Tube)</h3>
                <p><b>What is DVST?</b> </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>DVST stands for <b>Direct View Storage Tube</b>, a type of display device used to store and
                        display images without requiring constant refreshing.</li>
                    <li>Unlike modern displays, once an image is drawn on a DVST screen, it remains visible until
                        erased.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/cg2.jpeg" alt="">
                <p><strong>Step-by-Step Working of DVST (Direct View Storage Tube)</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Step 1: Writing the Image – The Role of the Primary Gun</strong></p>
                <p>The first step in DVST is creating the image, which is done by the Primary Electron Gun. This gun
                    generates a high-energy electron beam that is directed toward the screen. However, before it reaches
                    the screen, the beam passes through two important systems:
                <ol>
                    <li>Focusing System – This ensures the electron beam remains sharp and precise, preventing blurry or
                        distorted images.</li>
                    <li>Deflection System – This controls the movement of the beam, allowing it to draw different shapes
                        and patterns on the screen.</li>
                </ol>
                Now, instead of directly displaying the image, this electron beam interacts with a special Storage Grid.
                When the beam hits the Storage Grid, it creates an electric charge pattern that represents the image.
                This means the image is now stored, but we still can’t see anything yet. The Storage Grid essentially
                acts like an invisible memory that holds the drawing before it is displayed.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step 2: Making the Image Visible – The Role of the Flood Gun</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the image is stored, the Flood Gun takes over. Unlike the Primary Gun, which moves around
                        and draws, the Flood Gun emits a continuous flow of low-energy electrons that spread across the
                        entire screen. These electrons don’t carry an image themselves; instead, they act like a
                        background light source.</li>
                    <li>Before reaching the screen, the flood electrons pass through the Collector Mesh, which helps
                        filter out unnecessary electrons. This ensures that only the required electrons interact with
                        the Storage Grid. Now, here’s where the magic happens—
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where the Storage Grid has a stored charge (from the Primary Gun), it allows the flood
                                electrons to pass through.</li>
                            <li>Where there is no charge, the grid blocks the electrons.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>This selective passing of electrons creates the final image on the Phosphor-Coated Screen. The
                        phosphor coating glows when struck by the flood electrons, making the stored image visible to
                        the viewer.</li>
                    <li>To understand this better, imagine you have a glass stencil with a hidden design, and you shine
                        a flashlight behind it. The light will pass through only the cut-out areas, revealing the
                        pattern. That’s exactly how the Storage Grid works with the Flood Gun’s electrons!</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Step 3: Keeping the Image Stable – Why DVST Doesn’t Flicker</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One major advantage of DVST is that once an image is written, it remains on the screen without
                        flickering. This is because the Storage Grid continues to hold the charge, and the Flood Gun
                        continuously lights it up. Unlike traditional CRT monitors, which need to refresh the image
                        multiple times per second, DVST keeps displaying the same image without needing constant
                        updates.</li>
                    <li>This property made DVST useful for applications where stable images were required for a long
                        time, such as radar displays, industrial monitors, and scientific instruments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Step 4: Erasing & Redrawing – The Major Limitation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The biggest downside of DVST is that it cannot partially update the image. If any part of the
                        image needs to change, the entire screen must be erased and redrawn from scratch.</li>
                    <li>To erase an image, the Storage Grid’s charge must be neutralized, completely removing the stored
                        pattern. Once this happens, the screen becomes entirely blank, and the Primary Gun must redraw
                        everything from the beginning.</li>
                    <li>This makes DVST very slow for animations or dynamic displays, as even small updates require
                        erasing and redrawing the entire screen. That’s why it eventually became obsolete, replaced by
                        technologies that allow fast and smooth image updates.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Advantages of DVST</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stable Image – No Flickering:</strong> One of the biggest advantages of DVST is that
                        once an image is displayed, it remains visible without needing continuous refreshing. In
                        traditional CRT monitors, the electron beam must redraw the image multiple times per second to
                        keep it visible, which can cause flickering if the refresh rate is too low. However, in DVST,
                        the image is stored electrically in the storage grid, and the flood gun continuously lights it
                        up. This means there is no need for repeated redrawing, making it ideal for applications that
                        require stable and flicker-free images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Good for Detailed Graphics – No Need for Constant Redrawing</strong>: DVST is
                        particularly useful for displaying detailed and intricate graphics, such as technical drawings,
                        maps, and engineering blueprints. Since the image is permanently stored in the storage grid
                        until erased, there is no risk of distortion or loss of detail due to frequent refreshing. This
                        was especially beneficial in scientific and industrial fields where high-precision graphics were
                        necessary, such as displaying waveforms, architectural designs, and weather charts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Useful for Scientific and Industrial Applications:</strong> DVST found extensive use in
                        specialized fields where stable and precise visuals were critical. Some common applications
                        included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Radar Displays – Used in military and aviation systems to track aircraft, ships, and
                                weather conditions. Since radar screens need to display a stable image for long periods,
                                DVST was an ideal choice.</li>
                            <li>Oscilloscopes – Used in electronics and physics labs to study waveforms and signals. The
                                ability to hold an image without flickering made it easier for scientists and engineers
                                to analyze data.</li>
                            <li>Medical Imaging – Early medical imaging devices, such as X-ray monitors and
                                electrocardiogram (ECG) displays, used DVST to provide stable images for diagnosis.</li>
                            <li>Control Panels in Power Plants and Factories – DVST was used in process control systems,
                                where important real-time data, such as temperature, pressure, and electrical flow,
                                needed to be displayed clearly for operators.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages of DVST</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cannot Update Part of the Image – Requires Full Erasure & Redrawing</strong>: One of the
                        biggest drawbacks of DVST is that it does not allow partial updates. If any change is needed in
                        the displayed image, the entire screen must be completely erased and redrawn from scratch. This
                        makes it highly inefficient for dynamic applications, such as interactive systems or gaming,
                        where frequent updates are required.
                        <br>For example, if a small change was needed in a radar display, the entire map would have to
                        be erased and redrawn, causing delays and inefficiencies. This limitation made DVST unsuitable
                        for interactive applications where real-time updates are necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Slow for Animations – Not Suitable for Video or Real-Time Graphics</strong>: Since DVST
                        cannot refresh parts of the screen independently, it is extremely slow for animations and
                        real-time graphics. Unlike modern screens, where images are updated multiple times per second,
                        DVST can only display static images until manually erased. This makes it unsuitable for
                        applications like video playback, gaming, and interactive graphics.
                        <br>For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A moving object in a simulation would require the entire screen to be erased and redrawn
                                at each step, making animations impractically slow.</li>
                            <li>A video display would be impossible, as video requires constant updates at high speed
                                (typically 24-60 frames per second).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Outdated Technology – Replaced by LCD, LED, and OLED</strong>: With the advancement of
                        display technologies, DVST quickly became obsolete. Newer display systems such as LCD (Liquid
                        Crystal Display), LED (Light Emitting Diode), and OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) offered
                        significant improvements:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Faster Refresh Rates – Modern displays can update images in real time, making them ideal
                                for gaming, videos, and dynamic applications.</li>
                            <li>Lower Power Consumption – Unlike DVST, which requires continuous electron flow, LCDs and
                                OLEDs consume much less power, making them more energy-efficient.</li>
                            <li>Slimmer and Lighter Design – DVST screens were bulky and heavy, whereas modern displays
                                are sleek and portable.</li>
                        </ul>Due to these advancements, DVST is now primarily a historical topic, studied for its role
                        in the evolution of computer graphics and display technology.

                <h3>Flat Panel Display</h3>
                <p>A Flat Panel Display (FPD) is a thin, lightweight display technology that replaces the bulky Cathode
                    Ray Tube (CRT) screens. Unlike CRTs, which require a large vacuum tube, FPDs use modern electronic
                    methods to generate images, making them slimmer, energy-efficient, and more portable.</p>
                <h3>Flat Panel Display (FPD) – Advantages Over CRT</h3>

                <p>Flat-panel displays (FPDs) are modern video display devices that have several advantages over
                    traditional Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors. Unlike bulky CRTs, FPDs are sleek, energy-efficient,
                    and highly portable.</p>

                <p><strong>Here’s why FPDs are preferred over CRTs:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Thinner & Space-Saving Design</strong>
                        <p>One of the biggest advantages of flat-panel displays is that they are extremely thin compared
                            to CRTs, which have a large, bulky design.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Traditional CRTs</strong> require a deep cabinet to accommodate the electron gun
                                and phosphor-coated screen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flat-panel displays</strong> use modern technology like liquid crystals (LCDs)
                                or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to display images, eliminating the need for a deep
                                structure.</li>
                            <li>This thin profile allows FPDs to be:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mounted on walls (like LED TVs).</li>
                                    <li>Built into slim laptops and tablets.</li>
                                    <li>Even worn on the wrist (as in smartwatches).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong> Example:</strong> Flat-screen TVs can be hung on walls, whereas old CRT TVs needed
                            bulky furniture to support them.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Lightweight & Portable</strong>
                        <p>Another major advantage is that flat-panel displays are lightweight, making them easy to move
                            and transport.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CRT monitors contain heavy glass screens and metal components, making them difficult to
                                lift and carry.</li>
                            <li>FPDs use lightweight materials like thin plastic layers, LED panels, and liquid crystal
                                layers, significantly reducing weight.</li>
                            <li>Because of their low weight, FPDs can be easily integrated into portable devices like
                                smartphones, tablets, and laptops.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong> Example:</strong> A 32-inch CRT TV can weigh over 30 kg, while a 32-inch LED TV
                            weighs less than 5 kg!</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Low Power Consumption</strong>
                        <p>Flat-panel displays consume less power than CRTs, making them more energy-efficient and
                            cost-effective in the long run.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CRTs require a lot of power to operate because they use electron beams to continuously
                                refresh the image on the screen.</li>
                            <li>FPDs use modern technologies like LED backlighting and OLED pixels, which are designed
                                to operate at lower power levels.</li>
                            <li>Since FPDs don’t require constant electron beam movement, they generate less heat and
                                extend battery life in portable devices.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong> Example:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A CRT monitor consumes around 75-100W of power, while a similar-sized LCD/LED screen
                                only needs 20-40W.</li>
                            <li>This makes FPDs ideal for battery-powered devices like laptops, smartphones, and

                <h3>Two Categories of Flat-Panel Displays: Emissive and Non-Emissive</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Emissive Displays:</strong> Directly emit light to create images
                        <ul>
                            <li>Emissive displays are also called "emitters" because they convert electrical energy into
                                light to create images. These displays do not require an external light source; they
                                generate their own illumination. examples: Plasma Display Panels, LEDs, OLEDs</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Emissive Displays:</strong> Use external light sources and modify them to display
                        images.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Non-emissive displays do not generate their own light. Instead, they modify an external
                                light source (such as backlight or ambient light) to create an image. Example: LCDs.

                <h3>Plasma Panel Display</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plasma Panel Displays, also called Gas-Discharge Displays, were an early type of flat-panel
                        display used before LCDs and OLEDs became popular. The name "Plasma" comes from the fact that
                        these displays use ionized gas (plasma) to produce light. Unlike traditional CRT screens that
                        rely on an electron beam, plasma displays use tiny gas-filled cells that light up when
                        electricity is applied.</li>
                    <li>A Plasma Panel Display is a self-emissive display that uses small gas-filled cells (pixels) to
                        create an image. When an electric current passes through these cells, the gas inside (usually
                        neon or xenon) gets ionized into plasma. This process emits light, which is used to form images
                        on the screen.</li>
                    <li>Plasma panels do not need constant refreshing like CRTs because once a pixel is lit, it stays on
                        until deliberately erased. This makes them flicker-free and stable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Key Components of a Plasma Panel Display</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cathode (Negative Electrode)</strong>: The cathode is a set of fine wires arranged
                        horizontally across the panel. These wires deliver a negative voltage to the gas cells, sending
                        electrical signals to different parts of the screen. They work together with the anode to
                        control which areas of the display light up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anode (Positive Electrode)</strong>: The anode consists of another set of wires, but
                        these are arranged vertically and carry a positive voltage. When combined with the cathode
                        wires, they form a grid-like structure, determining which gas cells are activated and producing
                        the required image on the screen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fluorescent Cells (Gas Pockets)</strong>: These tiny pockets of neon or xenon gas are
                        trapped between two glass plates. When voltage is applied, the gas ionizes into plasma and
                        begins to glow. This emitted light is what creates the bright and vibrant visuals on the plasma
                        display.</li>
                    <li><strong>Glass Plates</strong>: The plasma cells are enclosed between two glass plates, which act
                        as capacitors to maintain the voltage across the display. These plates help ensure the screen
                        stays illuminated properly and protect the internal components from external damage.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>How Does a Plasma Panel Display Work?</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, we have Grid Activation. Inside the plasma screen, there is a grid of cathode and anode
                        wires. The cathode wires run horizontally, and the anode wires run vertically. Each point where
                        these wires intersect represents a single pixel on the screen. When a voltage is applied to a
                        particular intersection, it activates that specific pixel, determining which part of the screen
                        lights up.</li>
                    <li>Next comes the Ionization of Gas. Within each pixel, there are tiny cells filled with neon or
                        xenon gas. When voltage is applied between a cathode and an anode, the gas inside that specific
                        cell ionizes into plasma. This means the gas is now charged and ready to emit energy.</li>
                    <li>Then, we have Light Emission. Once the gas is ionized, it emits ultraviolet (UV) light. However,
                        UV light is invisible to our eyes, so each plasma cell is coated with fluorescent phosphors.
                        These phosphors react to UV light and glow in one of three colors—Red, Green, or Blue (RGB). By
                        combining these colors in different intensities, the display creates a full range of colors,
                        producing clear and vibrant images.</li>
                    <li>Now, unlike older CRT screens, plasma displays offer a Stable Display Without Refreshing. This
                        means that once a pixel is lit, it stays illuminated as long as voltage is applied. CRT screens
                        need constant refreshing to maintain an image, but plasma displays hold their image steady,
                        reducing flicker and improving picture quality.</li>
                    <li>Finally, there’s the Erasing & Updating the Screen. When an image needs to change, the voltage
                        is lowered to around 90V, which stops the ionization process and turns off the pixel. Then, a
                        new voltage pattern is applied to activate different pixels, creating the next frame of the
                        image. This process happens extremely fast, allowing plasma displays to smoothly transition
                        between images, making them perfect for high-quality visuals.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Advantages of Plasma Panel Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Resolution</strong>: Plasma panels were capable of displaying sharp and detailed
                        images with good clarity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Large Screen Size Possible</strong>: Plasma technology allowed for bigger screens (up to
                        100 inches), making them popular for televisions and digital signage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Less Volume & Weight</strong>: Compared to bulky CRTs, plasma displays were thinner and
                        lighter, making them easier to mount on walls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flicker-Free Display</strong>: Since plasma displays do not require constant refreshing,
                        the images remain stable without flickering, reducing eye strain.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages of Plasma Panel Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Poor Resolution in Early Models</strong>: The first plasma panels had lower resolution
                        compared to modern LCDs and OLEDs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Wiring & Addressing</strong>: Since each pixel requires a dedicated cathode and
                        anode, plasma panels had a complex wiring system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Difficult to Control Addressing</strong>: Controlling and updating specific pixels in
                        plasma displays was technically challenging, making manufacturing more expensive.</li>

                <h3>Light Emitting Diode (LED) Display</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>LED displays are one of the most popular and widely used display technologies today. They are
                        known for their bright visuals, energy efficiency, and long lifespan. The name "LED" (Light
                        Emitting Diode) comes from the fact that these displays use small diodes that emit light when
                        electricity is passed through them.</li>
                    <li>An LED display is a flat-panel display that uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the source of
                        light. Unlike older display technologies like CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) and Plasma, LED displays
                        are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thinner</li>
                            <li>Brighter</li>
                            <li>More energy-efficient</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>LEDs are tiny semiconductor devices that emit light when an electric current passes through
                        them. These LEDs can be arranged in a grid to form images, text, or videos.</li>
                    <li>Even though we call them "LED displays," many LED TVs today are actually LCD displays with LED
                        backlighting rather than pure LED panels.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How Does an LED Display Work?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An LED Display creates images using tiny Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) that produce bright,
                        colorful visuals. </li>
                    <li>First, there’s Electric Current Activation . A small voltage is applied to each LED in the
                        display. This voltage excites the electrons inside the LED material, causing them to move to a
                        higher energy state. This is the first step in generating light.</li>
                    <li>Next comes Light Emission . Once the excited electrons return to their original energy state,
                        they release photons (light energy). The color of this emitted light depends on the material
                        used in the LED. For example, some LEDs emit Red, Green, or Blue (RGB) light, which are the
                        primary colors used to create images on the screen.</li>
                    <li>Then, we have Brightness & Color Control . The intensity of light from each LED is controlled
                        by adjusting the amount of electric current passing through it. By carefully controlling the
                        brightness of individual Red, Green, and Blue LEDs, the display can produce millions of colors,
                        creating a smooth and realistic image.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the LEDs work together for Image Formation . LEDs are arranged in a pixel grid, and
                        each pixel is made up of three tiny LEDs—one Red, one Green, and one Blue (called sub-pixels).
                        By adjusting the brightness levels of these sub-pixels, the screen can display a wide range of
                        colors, forming clear and vibrant images.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Advantages of LED Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong> High Brightness & Contrast</strong>: LED displays are brighter than LCDs and visible
                        even in daylight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Efficient</strong>: LEDs consume less power compared to older display
                        technologies like CRT and Plasma.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slim & Lightweight</strong>: LED displays are thinner and lighter, making them ideal for
                        wall-mounted TVs and portable devices.</li>
                    <li><strong> Long Lifespan</strong>: LEDs can last 50,000+ hours, much longer than traditional
                        fluorescent backlights.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Flickering, Less Eye Strain</strong>: Since LEDs refresh faster and do not flicker,
                        they reduce eye strain and provide a smoother viewing experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmentally Friendly</strong>: LEDs do not contain harmful mercury (unlike old CRTs
                        and CCFL backlights).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages of LED Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Higher Cost</strong>: Pure LED panels (like OLED & MicroLED) are expensive compared to
                        LCDs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Viewing Angle Issues (for some models)</strong>: Some LED-backlit LCDs have limited
                        viewing angles, making colors look distorted from the sides.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backlight Bleeding (for LED-backlit LCDs)</strong>: In LED-backlit LCDs, some light
                        leaks around the edges, reducing contrast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shorter Lifespan for Certain Colors</strong>: Blue LEDs tend to degrade faster, leading
                        to color shifts over time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Where Are LED Displays Used?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>TVs & Monitors – LED-backlit LCDs are used in most modern televisions and computer screens.</li>
                    <li>Smartphones & Tablets – Most phones today use LED-backlit LCDs or OLED screens.</li>
                    <li> Outdoor Billboards – Large LED panels are used for advertising displays.</li>
                    <li> Traffic Lights & Signboards – LEDs are used in traffic signals and digital road signs.</li>
                    <li> Theater & Stage Displays – Concerts and events use large LED video walls.</li>

                <h3>Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is one of the most common display technologies used in devices like
                        televisions, computer monitors, smartphones, and more. It's known for its thin profile, good
                        image quality, and energy efficiency. However, unlike LED displays, LCDs don’t emit their own
                        light—they rely on a backlight to illuminate the display.</li>
                    <li>An LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) uses liquid crystals to form images. These liquid crystals don't
                        emit light directly, but instead, they manipulate light from a backlight source to produce
                        images.</li>
                    <li>The LCD screen’s "liquid crystal" doesn't mean it’s a liquid like water; it’s a special
                        substance that has properties of both liquids and solids, allowing it to adjust its transparency
                        when electricity is applied.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An LCD Display works by manipulating light to create vibrant images. </li>
                    <li>First, there’s the Backlight. To get the display to shine, an LED or fluorescent light is used
                        to shine through the LCD panel. This provides the necessary light for the display to work, as
                        the liquid crystals themselves don’t emit light.</li>
                    <li>Next, we have Liquid Crystals. These are special materials that can manipulate light when an
                        electric current is applied. When voltage is passed through them, the liquid crystals change
                        their alignment, controlling how light passes through them and allowing the display to produce
                        different shades.</li>
                    <li>Finally, there are Color Filters. The LCD uses filters to create the three primary colors—Red,
                        Green, and Blue—by manipulating the light passing through the liquid crystals. These colors mix
                        in different intensities to create a full spectrum of colors and form the image we see on the
                        screen.</li>
                    <li>And that’s how it works—using a backlight, liquid crystals, and color filters to produce images
                        with vibrant colors and sharp detail!</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Advantages of LCD Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Thin and Lightweight</strong>: LCDs are thinner and lighter compared to older CRTs,
                        making them easier to mount on walls or fit into compact spaces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Efficient</strong>: LCDs are much more energy-efficient compared to older display
                        technologies like CRT and Plasma.</li>

                <p><strong>Disadvantages of LCD Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Limited Viewing Angles</strong>: Color distortion can occur when viewed from an angle,
                        especially with older or cheaper LCDs. This is improved in IPS (In-Plane Switching) displays.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Lower Contrast Ratios</strong>: Compared to OLED and plasma displays, LCDs generally
                        have lower contrast ratios, which means blacks can appear greyish instead of deep black.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backlight Bleeding</strong>: Some LCDs (especially cheaper models) can have backlight
                        bleed, where light leaks around the edges or corners, affecting picture quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slower Response Times</strong>: Faster-moving images (like sports or action scenes) may
                        appear blurry on TN displays with slower response times.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Applications of LCD Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Televisions & Monitors</strong>: LCD TVs are very common for home entertainment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smartphones & Tablets</strong>: Most smartphones use IPS LCDs for vibrant color and good
                        viewing angles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Laptop Screens</strong>: Thin and lightweight, making them perfect for portable
                        computers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Watches & Clocks</strong>: Low power consumption and simple designs make LCD
                        ideal for portable, battery-operated devices.</li>

                <p>If you’ve ever used a printer, you might have noticed that some are noisier than others, some print
                    faster, and some produce crisp, high-quality prints while others seem a bit rough. That’s because
                    printers come in different types based on how they work. They are broadly classified into Impact
                    Printers and Non-Impact Printers. Let’s break them down in a simple way.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact Printers – The Old-School Workhorses</strong></p>
                <p>Impact printers are like typewriters—they print by physically striking an ink ribbon against the
                    paper to produce text or images. These printers are rugged and durable, making them great for
                    environments where printing needs to be continuous, like bill printing in shops or bank statements.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Impact Printers are further divided into:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Character Printers</li>
                            <li>Line Printers</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Character Printers – The Old-School Text Machines</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Character printers are a type of impact printer that print one character at a time.</li>
                            <li>Think of them like an old typewriter—they physically strike an ink ribbon against the
                                paper to produce letters and symbols.</li>
                            <li>While they might seem outdated today, they were once widely used in offices and
                                industries for document printing.</li>
                            <li>Since these printers work character by character, they are slower compared to modern
                                printers but were still considered efficient for their time.</li>
                            <li>They were mostly used in environments where text-based printing was the main
                                requirement, and fancy graphics or high-speed printing weren’t needed.</li>
                            <li>Character printers are further divided into two main types:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dot Matrix Printer</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How Does It Work?</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dot matrix printers are one of the most recognizable types of impact printers.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If you’ve ever seen those noisy, old-style receipt or invoice printers in a
                                        shop, you’ve probably come across a dot matrix printer.</li>
                                    <li>A dot matrix printer has a print head with tiny pins arranged in a grid (often
                                        9-pin or 24-pin).</li>
                                    <li>These pins strike against an ink ribbon to form characters or images using a
                                        series of dots.</li>
                                    <li>The more pins a printer has, the better the print quality.</li>
                                    <li>For example:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>A 9-pin dot matrix printer produces basic, rough characters.</li>
                                            <li>A 24-pin version offers better clarity and can even print simple
                                                graphics.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Since these printers rely on a mechanical impact, they are loud and slow, but
                                        they have one major advantage—they can print multiple copies at once using
                                        carbon paper (which is why they are still used for receipts and invoices).</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li> Can Print Carbon Copies: Unlike inkjet or laser printers, a dot matrix printer
                                        can print duplicate copies using multi-layered carbon paper in a single print
                                        job.</li>
                                    <li> Low Operating Cost: The ink ribbons used in dot matrix printers are cheaper
                                        compared to inkjet or toner cartridges.</li>
                                    <li> Durable and Reliable: These printers are rugged and can work in harsh
                                        environments like dusty warehouses and factories.</li>
                                    <li> Continuous Paper Printing: They can print on continuous sheets of perforated
                                        paper (like old-school computer printouts), making them ideal for logs and
                                        reports.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Disadvantages of Dot Matrix Printers</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Noisy Operation: Since the print head physically strikes the ribbon and paper,
                                        these printers make a loud clicking noise during printing.</li>
                                    <li> Slow Printing Speed: Because they print character by character, dot matrix
                                        printers are significantly slower than modern printers.</li>
                                    <li> Poor Print Quality: The characters and images are made up of small dots, so
                                        they look rough and pixelated compared to laser or inkjet prints.</li>
                                    <li> Limited Font Options: Dot matrix printers have fixed character sets, so they
                                        can’t print fancy fonts or high-resolution graphics.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                    <li>Retail and Billing: Many shops and supermarkets still use dot matrix printers to
                                        generate receipts.</li>
                                    <li>Banks and Financial Institutions: Used for printing passbooks, transaction logs,
                                        and statements.</li>
                                    <li>Factories and Warehouses: Since these printers can withstand dusty and rough
                                        conditions, they are still used for printing logs, orders, and shipping labels.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Railway and Bus Ticketing: Many older railway and bus systems still use dot
                                        matrix printers for printing tickets.</li>
                                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Daisy Wheel Printer – The Typewriter’s Digital Cousin</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How Does It Work?</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Daisy wheel printers are another type of character printer, but unlike dot
                                        matrix printers, they produce sharper and more professional-looking text.</li>
                                    <li>They were commonly used in offices before laser and inkjet printers took over.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>A daisy wheel printer has a circular disk (the "daisy wheel") with characters
                                        pre-formed on the edges.</li>
                                    <li>When you print something, the wheel rotates to the correct character, and a
                                        hammer strikes it against the ribbon and paper.</li>
                                    <li>This is similar to how a typewriter works, except it’s automated.</li>
                                    <li>Because each character is pre-formed, daisy wheel printers produce sharper text
                                        than dot matrix printers.</li>
                                    <li>However, they are still slow because they print one character at a time.</li>
                                    <li>They also cannot print images or graphics—only text.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Advantages of Daisy Wheel Printers</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> High Print Quality: Since the characters are pre-formed, the print quality is
                                        much sharper than dot matrix printers.</li>
                                    <li> More Professional Output: Daisy wheel printers were widely used in offices and
                                        legal documentation because of their clear, typewriter-like text.</li>
                                    <li> Less Maintenance: Since the characters are pre-made on the wheel, there are no
                                        pins to get damaged like in dot matrix printers.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Disadvantages of Daisy Wheel Printers</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Very Slow: Since they print one character at a time, daisy wheel printers are
                                        extremely slow compared to modern printers.</li>
                                    <li> No Graphics or Images: Unlike dot matrix printers, which can print simple
                                        graphics, daisy wheel printers only print text.</li>
                                    <li> Expensive Ribbons and Wheels: The ribbons and replacement daisy wheels were
                                        costly, making them less economical in the long run.</li>
                                    <li> Noisy Operation: Just like typewriters, these printers made a loud mechanical
                                        sound with each character printed.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Common Uses of Daisy Wheel Printers</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Official Documents: Before laser printers became common, these were used for
                                        printing legal documents, office letters, and contracts.</li>
                                    <li>Typewriter Replacement: Many businesses replaced manual typewriters with daisy
                                        wheel printers for automated document creation.</li>
                                    <li>Academic and Research Papers: Used in universities and offices for formal
                                        documentation.</li>

                    <li><strong>Line Printers – The Speedy Text Machines</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Line printers are a type of impact printer that print an entire line of text at once,
                                unlike character printers, which print one character at a time.</li>
                            <li>This feature makes them much faster than character printers.</li>
                            <li>Line printers were commonly used in environments where high-volume printing was needed,
                                such as in large corporations, data centers, and financial institutions.</li>
                            <li>While their print quality isn't as high as modern printers, they are fast, reliable, and
                                perfect for printing large batches of data.</li>
                            <li><strong>How Do Line Printers Work?</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Instead of printing characters individually, line printers use a mechanism that
                                        allows them to print an entire line in one go.</li>
                                    <li>There are two common types of line printers:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Drum Printers</li>
                                            <li>Chain Printers</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Both of these line printers use a mechanical method to strike an ink ribbon
                                        against the paper, printing one line at a time.</li>
                                    <li>The key difference lies in how they generate the text on the paper.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                    <li><strong>Drum Printer – The Heavy-Duty Workhorse</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How Does It Work?</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Drum printers have a rotating drum that contains pre-etched characters (think of
                                        a circular band with rows of letters).</li>
                                    <li>As the drum spins, the paper moves beneath it, and hammers strike the paper,
                                        creating the text.</li>
                                    <li>The drum’s rotation allows the printer to print an entire line at once, making
                                        it much faster than character printers.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Advantages of Drum Printers</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Fast Printing: Drum printers can print a whole line at a time, making them much
                                        faster than character printers.</li>
                                    <li> Durable: They are built to handle high-volume printing over long periods, which
                                        makes them a good choice for large companies.</li>
                                    <li> Low Maintenance: Since there are no small pins to wear out (like in dot matrix
                                        printers), drum printers generally require less maintenance.</li>
                                    <li> Good for Long Continuous Prints: They work well for printing reports, logs, and
                                        invoices that need continuous output.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Disadvantages of Drum Printers</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Limited to Pre-etched Characters: Drum printers are limited to the characters
                                        etched on the drum, so custom fonts or styles are impossible without changing
                                        the drum.</li>
                                    <li> Noisy: Like all impact printers, drum printers are noisy due to the mechanical
                                        hammers.</li>
                                    <li> Bulky and Heavy: These printers are often large and heavy, making them
                                        difficult to move or place in a small office.</li>
                                    <li> Limited Graphics Support: Drum printers are designed for text and cannot print
                                        high-quality images or complex graphics.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Large-Scale Business Printing: Drum printers were widely used for printing
                                        payroll in companies, financial reports, and statements that needed to be
                                        produced quickly.</li>
                                    <li>Data Centers: They were used in environments where logs and data sets needed to
                                        be printed continuously.</li>
                                    <li>Banking and Finance: Drum printers were popular in banks for printing accounting
                                        records and transaction logs.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Chain printers use a rotating chain of pre-formed characters, much like a drum
                                        printer, but instead of a drum, the characters are on a moving chain.</li>
                                    <li>The chain passes over a print head, which strikes the paper and prints the
                                        entire line at once.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Advantages of Chain Printers</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Faster Than Drum Printers: Chain printers tend to be faster than drum printers
                                        due to the continuous movement of the chain and the ability to adjust the
                                        character set.</li>
                                    <li> Flexible Character Sets: Chain printers allow for the replacement of the
                                        character chain, so you can use different fonts or change the characters
                                        printed.</li>
                                    <li> Durability and Reliability: These printers are designed to handle heavy
                                        workloads and can print for long hours without much wear and tear.</li>
                                    <li> High-Speed Printing: As with drum printers, chain printers can print an entire
                                        line of text at once, making them ideal for large printing jobs.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Disadvantages of Chain Printers</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Expensive Maintenance: While chain printers are more flexible than drum
                                        printers, they can be expensive to maintain, especially if the chains need
                                        frequent replacement.</li>
                                    <li> Still Noisy: Chain printers, like other impact printers, are quite loud due to
                                        the hammering mechanism.</li>
                                    <li> Limited Graphics Support: Like drum printers, they are not designed for
                                        printing high-quality images and are best used for text-based printing.</li>
                                    <li> Bulky: They are also large and heavy, taking up more space in an office
                                        environment compared to modern printers.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Common Uses of Chain Printers</strong>
                                <ul>

                                        monthly reports, financial statements, and logs.</li>
                                    <li>Large Businesses: In industries such as banking, insurance, and
                                        telecommunications, chain printers were used to print customer records, billing
                                        statements, and other documents that required fast and reliable printing.</li>
                                    <li>Data Centers and Warehouses: Like drum printers, chain printers were used in
                                        environments that required continuous output, such as printing large volumes of
                                        data for analysis or processing.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Non-impact printers are the modern type of printers that do not physically strike the paper
                            while printing.</li>
                        <li>Unlike impact printers (character and line printers) that use mechanical force to transfer
                            ink, non-impact printers spray ink or use heat and laser technology to create text and
                            images.</li>
                        <li>These printers are quieter, faster, and can print both text and images with high quality.
                        </li>
                        <li>They have completely replaced impact printers in most offices, homes, and industries because
                            they offer better print quality, support for graphics, and various printing materials.</li>
                        <li><strong>Types of Non-Impact Printers:</strong>

                    <li><strong>Inkjet Printers – The Budget-Friendly All-Rounder</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inkjet printers are the most common type of printers found in homes and offices.</li>
                            <li>They work by spraying tiny droplets of liquid ink onto the paper to create text and
                                images.</li>
                            <li>The ink is stored in cartridges and can be either black or colored, allowing inkjet
                                printers to print in full color as well.</li>
                            <li><strong>How Do Inkjet Printers Work?</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>An inkjet printer has small nozzles that spray ink onto the paper.</li>
                                    <li>The nozzles are controlled electronically to form letters, shapes, and images
                                        with precision.</li>
                                    <li>There are two main techniques used in inkjet printing:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Thermal Bubble (Bubble Jet) Technology:</strong> Uses heat to
                                                create small ink bubbles that burst and release ink onto the paper.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Piezoelectric Technology:</strong> Uses electric charges to
                                                control ink flow and spray droplets with high accuracy.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Advantages of Inkjet Printers</strong>
                                <ul>

                                        increasing the long-term cost of use.</li>
                                    <li> Slow Printing Speed: Compared to laser printers, inkjet printers are slower,
                                        especially when printing large volumes.</li>
                                    <li> Ink Smudging & Water Sensitivity: The ink can smudge if touched immediately
                                        after printing, and water can ruin prints.</li>
                                    <li> Requires Frequent Maintenance: Ink cartridges can dry out if not used
                                        regularly, leading to clogged nozzles and poor print quality.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>Laser printers are faster, sharper, and more cost-effective for bulk printing.</li>
                            <li>Instead of spraying ink, they use laser beams and toner (powdered ink) to produce
                                high-quality text and images.</li>
                            <li>These printers are commonly found in offices, businesses, and industries where fast and
                                professional printing is needed.</li>
                            <li><strong>How Do Laser Printers Work?</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Laser printers work using electrostatic charge and heat to transfer toner (a
                                        fine powder) onto paper.</li>
                                    <li>Here’s the process:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>A laser beam creates a pattern (your text or image) on a drum inside the
                                                printer.</li>
                                            <li>The drum is coated with toner powder, which sticks to the charged areas.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>The toner is then transferred onto the paper.</li>
                                            <li>Finally, the paper passes through a heated roller (fuser unit), which
                                                melts and fuses the toner onto the paper permanently.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Advantages of Laser Printers</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Super Fast Printing: Laser printers can print dozens of pages per minute,
                                        making them great for offices.</li>
                                    <li> Sharp and Smudge-Free Prints: Since toner is a dry powder, the prints don’t
                                        smudge and look crisp and professional.</li>
                                    <li> Lower Cost for Large Printing Jobs: While the upfront cost of a laser printer
                                        is high, the toner lasts longer than ink cartridges, making it cheaper in the
                                        long run.</li>
                                    <li> Durable & Low Maintenance: Laser printers don’t have clogging issues like
                                        inkjet printers, and they require less frequent maintenance.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li> Expensive Initial Cost: A laser printer costs more than an inkjet printer,
                                        especially color laser printers.</li>
                                    <li> Bulkier & Heavier: Most laser printers are large and heavy, taking up more
                                        space in offices.</li>
                                    <li> Limited Paper Compatibility: Unlike inkjets, laser printers don’t print well on
                                        glossy or specialty papers.</li>
                                    <li> Not Ideal for High-Quality Photo Printing: Laser printers are better for
                                        text-based printing, and photo printing quality is lower compared to inkjets.
                                    </li>

                <h3>Plotters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A plotter is a specialized printing device used for large-scale, high-precision graphics such as
                        architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, circuit diagrams, and banners. Unlike
                        traditional printers, which print by spraying ink or using toner, plotters use pens, inkjet
                        heads, or cutting blades to create smooth, continuous lines.</li>
                    <li>Plotters are mainly used in industries where accuracy and detail are critical, such as
                        engineering, architecture, graphic design, and manufacturing. They can handle larger paper sizes
                        (A0, A1, A2) and even materials like vinyl, fabric, and plastic sheets.</li>
                    <li><strong>How Do Plotters Work?</strong>: Unlike regular printers that print pixel-by-pixel,
                        plotters use mechanical arms or moving printheads to draw precise lines on a surface. This
                        allows them to create extremely detailed and accurate drawings. Plotters can either use pens for
                        traditional drawing, inkjets for high-resolution color graphics, or blades for cutting designs.

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Drum Plotter – The Rotating Precision Machine</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A drum plotter has a rotating drum that moves the paper while the pen moves side-to-side
                                to create drawings.</li>
                            <li>The paper is wrapped around the drum, and as the drum rotates, the pen moves according
                                to the programmed design.</li>
                            <li><strong> Used For:</strong>
                                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Flatbed Plotter – The Blueprint Specialist</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A flatbed plotter has a fixed, flat surface where the paper (or other material) is
                                placed.</li>
                            <li>The pens move in both horizontal (X-axis) and vertical (Y-axis) directions to draw the
                                design.</li>
                            <li>Unlike a drum plotter, the paper does not move, making it more stable for detailed and
                                delicate drawings.</li>

            <h2>Digital Image Representation and Rendering Techniques</h2>
            <p>Understanding Digital Images</p>

            <p>Before we dive into the techniques, let’s first understand what a digital image is.</p>

            <p>A digital image is basically a grid of tiny squares called pixels (short for “picture elements”). Each
                pixel contains color information, and when you zoom in, you can see that the image is made up of these
                little blocks.</p>

            <p>Images can be represented in two main ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Raster Images (Bitmap Images)</strong> – Made up of pixels (e.g., PNG, JPEG). These images
                    lose quality when zoomed in because the pixels become visible.</li>
                <li><strong>Vector Images</strong> – Made using mathematical equations (e.g., SVG, AI). These can be
                    scaled infinitely without losing quality.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now that we know what digital images are, let’s talk about some common issues and techniques used to
                improve how images look on screens and in prints.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Dithering – Faking More Colors with Patterns</strong></p>

                    <p>Problem: What if a device or printer can only display a limited number of colors, but we need
                        more? That’s where dithering comes in.</p>

                    <p><strong>What is Dithering?</strong></p>

                    <p>Dithering is a technique that creates the illusion of more colors by placing tiny dots of
                        different colors next to each other. When viewed from a distance, our eyes mix these dots and
                        perceive a new color that isn’t actually there!</p>

                    <p>Example:</p>

                    <p>Imagine you only have black and white dots but want to display gray. Instead of a solid gray
                        pixel, the system places black and white dots close together. When you step back, it looks like
                        a shade of gray.</p>

                    <p><strong>Where is Dithering Used?</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Old video games (which had limited color palettes).</li>
                        <li>Low-color displays (like early computer monitors).</li>
                        <li>Printing (especially in newspapers and comics).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Makes images look better when the color range is limited.</p>

                    <p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Can create a grainy or noisy effect.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Half-toning – The Trick Behind Newspaper Images</strong></p>

                    <p>Problem: How do printers create images using only black ink?</p>

                    <p><strong>What is Half-toning?</strong></p>

                    <p>Half-toning is a special form of dithering used in printing. Instead of solid colors, images are
                        made up of tiny dots of different sizes and spacing. Large dots form darker areas, while smaller
                        dots form lighter areas.</p>

                    <p>Example:</p>

                    <p>Pick up a newspaper and look at a photo closely—you’ll notice it’s actually made of tiny dots!
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Where is Half-toning Used?</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Newspapers & Magazines (since they use limited ink colors).</li>
                        <li>Black-and-white printing (to create shades of gray).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Allows printers to create detailed images using just one ink color.</p>

                    <p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Loses detail compared to full-color images.</p>
                </li>

                    <p><strong>Aliasing – Why Do Some Images Look Jagged?</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
                    <p>Why do diagonal lines or curves sometimes look like a staircase of tiny squares instead of being
                        smooth?</p>

                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong></p>
                    <p>Aliasing happens because pixels are square-shaped. When we try to display a diagonal or curved
                        shape, the edges don’t align perfectly with the pixel grid, making them look jagged.</p>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Old video games (characters and objects had sharp, blocky edges).</li>
                        <li>Low-resolution screens (text and images appeared rough).</li>
                        <li>3D graphics without smoothing techniques (early 3D models looked jagged).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Makes images and text look unnatural and rough.</p>

                    <p>Anti-aliasing smooths out jagged edges by blending pixels at the edges with intermediate shades,
                        creating a more natural transition.</p>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Modern video games (use anti-aliasing to make graphics look smooth).</li>
                        <li>Text rendering (makes letters easier to read on digital screens).</li>
                        <li>3D animation & modeling (avoids blocky edges in animated movies).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Makes graphics and text look smoother and more realistic.</p>

                    <p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Uses more processing power, which can slow down performance in
                        real-time applications.</p>
