        <h1>Intro to Computer Graphics</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Computer Graphics is all about creating, manipulating, and displaying images using computers. In simple
                words, it deals with generating visuals; whether it's the images you see in video games, the UI of apps,
                3D animations in movies, or even the graphs and charts in reports.</li>
            <li>It’s a field that blends mathematics, programming, and design to create visual content. The main goal is
                to make computers generate images efficiently and allow users to interact with them in meaningful ways.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Common Uses of Computer Graphics</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Entertainment:</b> Used in movies, animations, and video games to create realistic graphics
                        and special effects.</li>
                    <li><b>Education & Training:</b> Helps in simulations for medical training, flight simulators, and
                        interactive learning apps.</li>
                    <li><b>Scientific Visualization:</b> Used to represent complex data, such as weather models, medical
                        imaging (MRI, CT scans), and engineering designs.</li>
                    <li><b>Architecture & Design:</b> Enables 3D modeling for buildings, interior design, and urban
                        planning.</li>
                    <li><b>UI/UX Design:</b> Enhances user interfaces in websites, mobile apps, and software, making
                        them more intuitive.</li>
                    <li><b>Advertising & Marketing:</b> Used in digital posters, product visualizations, and animated
                        commercials.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How Images are Formed in Computer Graphics?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In computer graphics, images are displayed using tiny square units called pixels, arranged in a
                        grid.</li>
                    <li>By controlling the color and brightness of each pixel, we can create detailed pictures and
                        graphics.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Converting Shapes into Pixels</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>When a computer needs to display a shape, it must determine which pixels will best represent it
                        on
                        the screen.</li>
                    <li>This process of converting shapes into a set of pixels is called <b>Rasterization</b>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Displaying Continuous Images on Screens</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Real-world images and objects have smooth curves and edges, but digital screens are made up of
                        individual pixels.</li>
                    <li>To display continuous images on a screen, they must be broken down into discrete pixels.</li>
                    <li>This process is known as <b>Scan Conversion</b>, and it helps display curves and lines as
                        accurately
                        as possible.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advantages of Computer Graphics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Computer graphics make it super easy to communicate with a computer using visuals instead of just text
                or numbers.</li>
            <li>It helps us create both <b>real-world images</b> (like photos and 3D models) and <b>imaginary
                    objects</b> (like 4D mathematical shapes or data visualizations that don’t have a physical form).
            </li>
            <li>One of the coolest things about computer graphics is that it can show <b>moving pictures</b>, making
                animations possible.</li>
            <li>We can fully control animations—adjust the <b>speed</b>, zoom in or out, and decide how much detail to
                show.</li>
            <li>There’s something called <b>Motion Dynamics</b>, which lets users move objects or change viewpoints in
                real time.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: Ever seen a virtual tour of a house before buying it? That’s motion dynamics in action!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Another feature is <b>Update Dynamics</b>, which lets us change an object’s <b>shape</b>, <b>color</b>,
                or other properties whenever needed.</li>
            <li>With new tech in digital sound processing, computer graphics can now include <b>audio feedback</b>
                too—so it’s not just about visuals anymore!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Applications of Computer Graphics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>User Interface:</b> One of the most useful applications of computer graphics is the <b>visual
                    objects</b> on the screen that help us interact with the computer. These are the buttons, icons, and
                menus we click or touch, making it easier for us to use software.</li>
            <li><b>Plotting Graphics and Charts:</b> Computer graphics are used to draw graphs like <b>bars, pie charts,
                    and histograms</b>. These are super helpful in business, government, and educational organizations
                for making quick and informed decisions.</li>
            <li><b>Office Automation and Desktop Publishing:</b> Graphics help in creating and sharing documents with
                text, tables, graphs, and even scanned or drawn images. It makes office work smoother and helps in
                <b>printing documents</b> efficiently.
            </li>
            <li><b>Computer-Aided Drafting and Design (CAD):</b> Graphics are used to design everything from
                <b>automobile bodies</b> to <b>building structures</b>. It allows for accurate modeling of components
                and systems before they are built.
            </li>
            <li><b>Simulation and Animation:</b> Computer graphics make <b>mathematical models</b> and mechanical
                systems more realistic and easy to study. It’s widely used in simulations to understand complex systems
                better.</li>
            <li><b>Art and Commerce:</b> Graphics tools are used by artists and advertisers to create <b>animated</b>
                and eye-catching images for promotions and campaigns.</li>
            <li><b>Process Control:</b> In modern systems, automation is often graphically displayed on the screen,
                helping control processes easily and effectively.</li>
            <li><b>Cartography:</b> Graphics are used to create and display maps—such as <b>geographic maps</b>,
                <b>weather maps</b>, and <b>oceanographic charts</b>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Education and Training:</b> Computer graphics are used to create <b>models</b> of physical,
                financial, and economic systems. These models can be helpful educational tools to understand complex
                concepts.</li>
            <li><b>Image Processing:</b> Graphics help in processing images, such as adjusting their <b>properties</b>
                (like brightness, contrast, or resolution) to enhance or modify them for specific purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Computer Graphics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>NICG (Non-Interactive Computer Graphics):</b> Also known as <b>passive graphics</b>, this type
                involves content that is pre-generated and does not allow user interaction. The visual content is
                displayed without any user input.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: <b>Screen savers</b> or movies where the viewer simply watches without interacting with
                        the visuals.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>ICG (Interactive Computer Graphics):</b> In contrast to NICG, interactive graphics allow the user to
                engage and manipulate the visual content in real time.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: <b>Video games</b>, virtual reality, or interactive design software where users can
                        control or change the graphics with inputs (like clicking or moving a mouse).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Cathode Ray Tube</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) is an electronic display device used primarily in older televisions and
                        computer monitors. It works by firing electrons at a phosphor-coated screen, which lights up to
                        form an image. The CRT operates by manipulating the electron beam and using a series of
                        components to direct it onto the screen in such a way that it creates a full image.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/cg1.jpeg" alt="">
                <p><strong>Main Components of a CRT</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Connector Pins and Base</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The CRT’s base contains connector pins that connect the tube to external circuits. These
                                pins deliver power and control signals to the internal components, like the electron gun
                                and deflection system.</li>
                            <li>They serve as the interface between the CRT and the rest of the system, providing
                                necessary power and signals to function properly.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Electron Gun</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Located at the rear of the tube, the electron gun is responsible for emitting a stream
                                of electrons that are directed toward the screen.</li>
                            <li>It consists of the following parts:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Cathode: A heated filament that emits electrons when heated.</li>
                                    <li>Control Grid: Regulates the flow of electrons from the cathode to ensure the
                                        correct brightness and intensity.</li>
                                    <li>Anode: Attracts the negatively charged electrons and accelerates them toward the
                                        screen.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Focusing System</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This system focuses the electron beam into a fine point. It is made up of
                                        electromagnetic or electrostatic lenses that direct the beam, ensuring that the
                                        electrons don’t scatter.</li>
                                    <li>By controlling the beam’s focus, the image produced is sharp and clear.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Deflection System (Vertical and Horizontal)</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The deflection system moves the electron beam across the screen. It works in two
                                        directions:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Vertical Deflection: Uses electromagnetic coils that create a magnetic
                                                field to move the electron beam up and down on the screen.</li>
                                            <li>Horizontal Deflection: Uses a separate set of coils or deflection plates
                                                to move the beam left and right.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>

                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Phosphor-Coated Screen</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The front of the CRT is coated with phosphor material that glows when hit by the
                                        electron beam. This screen is divided into red, green, and blue sections (RGB),
                                        allowing the creation of full-color images by controlling the intensity and
                                        duration of electron impacts.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Working of a CRT</strong></p>
                <p>Now, let’s understand how all these components work together to display an image.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Electron Emission (Electron Gun)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The electron gun at the back of the CRT emits electrons. The cathode inside the gun
                                heats up, causing it to release electrons.</li>
                            <li>The control grid adjusts how many electrons can pass through to ensure the correct
                                brightness for the image.</li>
                            <li>The anode attracts the electrons and accelerates them toward the phosphor-coated screen.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Focusing the Electron Beam</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once the electrons are emitted, they need to be focused into a fine beam so that they
                                don’t spread out and blur the image. The focusing system directs the beam, ensuring it
                                stays tight and clear.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Deflecting the Electron Beam (Vertical and Horizontal)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The electron beam is directed across the screen in a raster pattern—starting at the
                                top-left corner and sweeping across to the right, then moving down to the next line.
                            </li>
                            <li>The vertical deflection system moves the beam up or down using electromagnetic coils or
                                deflection plates. The amount of voltage applied to these coils determines the vertical
                                position of the beam.</li>
                            <li>Similarly, the horizontal deflection system moves the beam left or right. It works in
                                synchronization with the vertical system to ensure the beam covers the entire screen.

                            <li>Both deflection systems allow the electron beam to cover the whole screen
                                systematically.</li>

                    <li><strong>Phosphor Coating and Image Creation</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The phosphor-coated screen reacts when the electron beam hits it. The phosphor material
                                emits light in different colors (red, green, blue) depending on the section of the
                                screen the electron hits.</li>
                            <li>The screen is made up of millions of tiny phosphor dots or pixels, and each pixel
                                consists of subpixels for red, green, and blue colors.</li>
                            <li>The electron beam is directed to specific pixels, exciting the phosphor and making it
                                glow, which in turn creates part of the image.</li>
                            <li>By controlling the intensity and the location of the electron beam, a full-color image
                                is formed, pixel by pixel.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Image Refresh</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The CRT works by continuously refreshing the image many times per second. This happens
                                so quickly that our eyes perceive a stable image.</li>
                            <li>The scanning of the electron beam happens in a very fast, systematic pattern, creating
                                the illusion of a steady image.</li>
                        </ul>

                </ol>
                <p><strong>Scanning Types in CRT</strong></p>
                <p>In a CRT, scanning refers to how the electron beam moves across the screen to create an image. There
                    are two main types of scanning:
                <ol>
                    <li>Raster Scan</li>
                    <li>Random Scan</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Raster Scan</strong></p>
                <p>Raster scan is the most common type of scanning used in televisions and monitors. In this method, the
                    electron beam systematically moves across the screen in a fixed pattern, covering the entire screen
                    line by line from top to bottom.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How It Works
                        <ul>
                            <li>The electron beam starts at the top-left corner of the screen.</li>
                            <li>It moves horizontally from left to right while turning pixels on or off to create part
                                of the image.</li>
                            <li>When it reaches the right edge, the beam quickly moves back to the left in a process
                                called horizontal retrace.</li>
                            <li>The beam then moves down to the next line and repeats the process.</li>
                            <li>After scanning all the lines, the beam reaches the bottom-right corner.</li>
                            <li>It then returns to the top-left corner in a process called vertical retrace and starts
                                scanning the next frame.</li>
                        </ul>
                        This process repeats many times per second to maintain a smooth and continuous image.

                            <li>Used in TVs, monitors, and digital displays.</li>
                            <li>Covers the entire screen, whether the image needs it or not.</li>
                            <li>Requires a frame buffer, which stores the image before it is displayed.</li>
                            <li>Works well for detailed, complex images.</li>
                            <li>May experience flickering, which is reduced by increasing the refresh rate.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Example Applications
                        <ul>
                            <li>Televisions and computer monitors.</li>
                            <li>Video games and multimedia displays.</li>

                <p><strong>Random Scan</strong></p>
                <p>Random scan, also known as vector scan or stroke writing, is different from raster scanning because
                    the electron beam moves only to the parts of the screen where drawing is required. It does not scan
                    the entire screen line by line.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How It Works
                        <ul>
                            <li>The beam directly moves from one point to another to draw the image.</li>
                            <li>Instead of scanning the whole screen, it only draws lines, curves, and shapes as needed.
                            </li>
                            <li>The beam moves in any order instead of a fixed top-to-bottom pattern.</li>
                            <li>The image is drawn by connecting points to form shapes, similar to how a pen plots
                                points on paper.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Not suitable for complex, detailed images because the beam must trace every line
                                individually.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>How it works:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: The electron beam systematically moves line by line from top to bottom,
                                scanning the entire screen even if only a small portion of the image changes. Each pixel
                                on the screen is updated based on the image stored in the frame buffer.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: The electron beam directly moves to specific points on the screen where
                                drawing is required, instead of scanning the entire screen. It draws shapes like lines
                                and curves by moving from one coordinate to another, like a pen on paper.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Speed:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: Slower compared to random scan because the entire screen is redrawn
                                multiple times per second, even if some parts remain unchanged. The refresh rate
                                determines how often the screen is updated (e.g., 60Hz means 60 times per second).</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: Faster for line-based graphics because it only draws the necessary parts of
                                the image instead of scanning the whole screen. It does not need to continuously refresh
                                every pixel, making it more efficient for simple images.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Image Type:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: Best suited for detailed and complex images such as photographs, videos,
                                and realistic graphics. Since every pixel is individually updated, it can handle
                                high-resolution images smoothly.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: Works well for simple line drawings and geometric shapes. Since it does not
                                scan the entire screen, it is inefficient for complex images that require shading and
                                detailed textures.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Flickering:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: May experience flickering, especially at lower refresh rates. This happens
                                because the image needs to be continuously refreshed, and if the refresh rate is too
                                low, the human eye perceives noticeable flickers. Higher refresh rates (e.g., 120Hz)
                                reduce flickering.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: Produces minimal flicker since the electron beam directly draws the
                                necessary parts and does not rely on a full-screen refresh. This makes it more stable
                                for applications that require precision, such as scientific measurements and CAD
                                drawings.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: Widely used in TVs, computer monitors, gaming consoles, and multimedia
                                displays where full-screen graphics, colors, and animations are needed. All modern
                                digital screens use raster scanning to create smooth visuals.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: Mostly used in CAD (Computer-Aided Design) systems, oscilloscopes, and
                                radar displays where only wireframe graphics or simple geometric patterns are needed. It
                                was popular in early computer graphics systems before raster scanning became dominant.
                            </li>

                    <li>Fame Buffer Needed?:
                        <ol>
                            <li> Raster Scan: Yes, a frame buffer is required to store image data before it is
                                displayed. The frame buffer holds pixel information and refreshes the screen
                                continuously, ensuring smooth images.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: No, since the beam only moves to the required points, there is no need for
                                a frame buffer. The image is directly generated by controlling the beam’s movement,
                                reducing memory requirements.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Quick Working Difference:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raster Scan: Think of this like how you read a book—line by line, from top to bottom.
                                The electron beam sweeps across the entire screen, updating every pixel whether it needs
                                to change or not. Even if only a small part of the image changes, the whole screen gets
                                refreshed again and again. This is how TVs, monitors, and modern displays work.</li>
                            <li>Random Scan: Now, imagine drawing with a pen. Instead of covering everything, you only
                                move the pen where needed to create lines, curves, or shapes. That’s exactly how Random
                                Scan works—the electron beam jumps directly to the parts that need drawing instead of
                                scanning the whole screen. This makes it perfect for simple line drawings, like CAD
                                designs or radar screens.</li>
                        </ol>
                        So basically, Raster Scan is like a typewriter (covering everything line by line), while Random
                        Scan is like a pen (drawing only what’s needed).

                <h3>DVST (Direct View Storage Tube)</h3>
                <p><b>What is DVST?</b> </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>DVST stands for <b>Direct View Storage Tube</b>, a type of display device used to store and
                        display images without requiring constant refreshing.</li>
                    <li>Unlike modern displays, once an image is drawn on a DVST screen, it remains visible until
                        erased.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/cg2.jpeg" alt="">
                <p><strong>Step-by-Step Working of DVST (Direct View Storage Tube)</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Step 1: Writing the Image – The Role of the Primary Gun</strong></p>
                <p>The first step in DVST is creating the image, which is done by the Primary Electron Gun. This gun
                    generates a high-energy electron beam that is directed toward the screen. However, before it reaches
                    the screen, the beam passes through two important systems:
                <ol>
                    <li>Focusing System – This ensures the electron beam remains sharp and precise, preventing blurry or
                        distorted images.</li>
                    <li>Deflection System – This controls the movement of the beam, allowing it to draw different shapes
                        and patterns on the screen.</li>
                </ol>
                Now, instead of directly displaying the image, this electron beam interacts with a special Storage Grid.
                When the beam hits the Storage Grid, it creates an electric charge pattern that represents the image.
                This means the image is now stored, but we still can’t see anything yet. The Storage Grid essentially
                acts like an invisible memory that holds the drawing before it is displayed.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step 2: Making the Image Visible – The Role of the Flood Gun</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the image is stored, the Flood Gun takes over. Unlike the Primary Gun, which moves around
                        and draws, the Flood Gun emits a continuous flow of low-energy electrons that spread across the
                        entire screen. These electrons don’t carry an image themselves; instead, they act like a
                        background light source.</li>
                    <li>Before reaching the screen, the flood electrons pass through the Collector Mesh, which helps
                        filter out unnecessary electrons. This ensures that only the required electrons interact with
                        the Storage Grid. Now, here’s where the magic happens—
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where the Storage Grid has a stored charge (from the Primary Gun), it allows the flood
                                electrons to pass through.</li>
                            <li>Where there is no charge, the grid blocks the electrons.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>This selective passing of electrons creates the final image on the Phosphor-Coated Screen. The
                        phosphor coating glows when struck by the flood electrons, making the stored image visible to
                        the viewer.</li>
                    <li>To understand this better, imagine you have a glass stencil with a hidden design, and you shine
                        a flashlight behind it. The light will pass through only the cut-out areas, revealing the
                        pattern. That’s exactly how the Storage Grid works with the Flood Gun’s electrons!</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Step 3: Keeping the Image Stable – Why DVST Doesn’t Flicker</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One major advantage of DVST is that once an image is written, it remains on the screen without
                        flickering. This is because the Storage Grid continues to hold the charge, and the Flood Gun
                        continuously lights it up. Unlike traditional CRT monitors, which need to refresh the image
                        multiple times per second, DVST keeps displaying the same image without needing constant
                        updates.</li>
                    <li>This property made DVST useful for applications where stable images were required for a long
                        time, such as radar displays, industrial monitors, and scientific instruments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Step 4: Erasing & Redrawing – The Major Limitation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The biggest downside of DVST is that it cannot partially update the image. If any part of the
                        image needs to change, the entire screen must be erased and redrawn from scratch.</li>
                    <li>To erase an image, the Storage Grid’s charge must be neutralized, completely removing the stored
                        pattern. Once this happens, the screen becomes entirely blank, and the Primary Gun must redraw
                        everything from the beginning.</li>
                    <li>This makes DVST very slow for animations or dynamic displays, as even small updates require
                        erasing and redrawing the entire screen. That’s why it eventually became obsolete, replaced by
                        technologies that allow fast and smooth image updates.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Advantages of DVST</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stable Image – No Flickering:</strong> One of the biggest advantages of DVST is that
                        once an image is displayed, it remains visible without needing continuous refreshing. In
                        traditional CRT monitors, the electron beam must redraw the image multiple times per second to
                        keep it visible, which can cause flickering if the refresh rate is too low. However, in DVST,
                        the image is stored electrically in the storage grid, and the flood gun continuously lights it
                        up. This means there is no need for repeated redrawing, making it ideal for applications that
                        require stable and flicker-free images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Good for Detailed Graphics – No Need for Constant Redrawing</strong>: DVST is
                        particularly useful for displaying detailed and intricate graphics, such as technical drawings,
                        maps, and engineering blueprints. Since the image is permanently stored in the storage grid
                        until erased, there is no risk of distortion or loss of detail due to frequent refreshing. This
                        was especially beneficial in scientific and industrial fields where high-precision graphics were
                        necessary, such as displaying waveforms, architectural designs, and weather charts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Useful for Scientific and Industrial Applications:</strong> DVST found extensive use in
                        specialized fields where stable and precise visuals were critical. Some common applications
                        included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Radar Displays – Used in military and aviation systems to track aircraft, ships, and
                                weather conditions. Since radar screens need to display a stable image for long periods,
                                DVST was an ideal choice.</li>
                            <li>Oscilloscopes – Used in electronics and physics labs to study waveforms and signals. The
                                ability to hold an image without flickering made it easier for scientists and engineers
                                to analyze data.</li>
                            <li>Medical Imaging – Early medical imaging devices, such as X-ray monitors and
                                electrocardiogram (ECG) displays, used DVST to provide stable images for diagnosis.</li>
                            <li>Control Panels in Power Plants and Factories – DVST was used in process control systems,
                                where important real-time data, such as temperature, pressure, and electrical flow,
                                needed to be displayed clearly for operators.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages of DVST</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cannot Update Part of the Image – Requires Full Erasure & Redrawing</strong>: One of the
                        biggest drawbacks of DVST is that it does not allow partial updates. If any change is needed in
                        the displayed image, the entire screen must be completely erased and redrawn from scratch. This
                        makes it highly inefficient for dynamic applications, such as interactive systems or gaming,
                        where frequent updates are required.
                        <br>For example, if a small change was needed in a radar display, the entire map would have to
                        be erased and redrawn, causing delays and inefficiencies. This limitation made DVST unsuitable
                        for interactive applications where real-time updates are necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Slow for Animations – Not Suitable for Video or Real-Time Graphics</strong>: Since DVST
                        cannot refresh parts of the screen independently, it is extremely slow for animations and
                        real-time graphics. Unlike modern screens, where images are updated multiple times per second,
                        DVST can only display static images until manually erased. This makes it unsuitable for
                        applications like video playback, gaming, and interactive graphics.
                        <br>For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A moving object in a simulation would require the entire screen to be erased and redrawn
                                at each step, making animations impractically slow.</li>
                            <li>A video display would be impossible, as video requires constant updates at high speed
                                (typically 24-60 frames per second).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Outdated Technology – Replaced by LCD, LED, and OLED</strong>: With the advancement of
                        display technologies, DVST quickly became obsolete. Newer display systems such as LCD (Liquid
                        Crystal Display), LED (Light Emitting Diode), and OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) offered
                        significant improvements:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Faster Refresh Rates – Modern displays can update images in real time, making them ideal
                                for gaming, videos, and dynamic applications.</li>
                            <li>Lower Power Consumption – Unlike DVST, which requires continuous electron flow, LCDs and
                                OLEDs consume much less power, making them more energy-efficient.</li>
                            <li>Slimmer and Lighter Design – DVST screens were bulky and heavy, whereas modern displays
                                are sleek and portable.</li>
                        </ul>Due to these advancements, DVST is now primarily a historical topic, studied for its role
                        in the evolution of computer graphics and display technology.

                <h3>Flat Panel Display</h3>
                <p>A Flat Panel Display (FPD) is a thin, lightweight display technology that replaces the bulky Cathode
                    Ray Tube (CRT) screens. Unlike CRTs, which require a large vacuum tube, FPDs use modern electronic
                    methods to generate images, making them slimmer, energy-efficient, and more portable.</p>
                <h3>Flat Panel Display (FPD) – Advantages Over CRT</h3>

                <p>Flat-panel displays (FPDs) are modern video display devices that have several advantages over
                    traditional Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors. Unlike bulky CRTs, FPDs are sleek, energy-efficient,
                    and highly portable.</p>

                <p><strong>Here’s why FPDs are preferred over CRTs:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Thinner & Space-Saving Design</strong>
                        <p>One of the biggest advantages of flat-panel displays is that they are extremely thin compared
                            to CRTs, which have a large, bulky design.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Traditional CRTs</strong> require a deep cabinet to accommodate the electron gun
                                and phosphor-coated screen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flat-panel displays</strong> use modern technology like liquid crystals (LCDs)
                                or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to display images, eliminating the need for a deep
                                structure.</li>
                            <li>This thin profile allows FPDs to be:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mounted on walls (like LED TVs).</li>
                                    <li>Built into slim laptops and tablets.</li>
                                    <li>Even worn on the wrist (as in smartwatches).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong> Example:</strong> Flat-screen TVs can be hung on walls, whereas old CRT TVs needed
                            bulky furniture to support them.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Lightweight & Portable</strong>
                        <p>Another major advantage is that flat-panel displays are lightweight, making them easy to move
                            and transport.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CRT monitors contain heavy glass screens and metal components, making them difficult to
                                lift and carry.</li>
                            <li>FPDs use lightweight materials like thin plastic layers, LED panels, and liquid crystal
                                layers, significantly reducing weight.</li>
                            <li>Because of their low weight, FPDs can be easily integrated into portable devices like
                                smartphones, tablets, and laptops.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong> Example:</strong> A 32-inch CRT TV can weigh over 30 kg, while a 32-inch LED TV
                            weighs less than 5 kg!</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Low Power Consumption</strong>
                        <p>Flat-panel displays consume less power than CRTs, making them more energy-efficient and
                            cost-effective in the long run.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CRTs require a lot of power to operate because they use electron beams to continuously
                                refresh the image on the screen.</li>
                            <li>FPDs use modern technologies like LED backlighting and OLED pixels, which are designed
                                to operate at lower power levels.</li>
                            <li>Since FPDs don’t require constant electron beam movement, they generate less heat and
                                extend battery life in portable devices.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong> Example:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A CRT monitor consumes around 75-100W of power, while a similar-sized LCD/LED screen
                                only needs 20-40W.</li>
                            <li>This makes FPDs ideal for battery-powered devices like laptops, smartphones, and
                                smartwatches.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Two Categories of Flat-Panel Displays: Emissive and Non-Emissive</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Emissive Displays:</strong> Directly emit light to create images
                        <ul>
                            <li>Emissive displays are also called "emitters" because they convert electrical energy into
                                light to create images. These displays do not require an external light source; they
                                generate their own illumination. examples: Plasma Display Panels, LEDs, OLEDs</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Emissive Displays:</strong> Use external light sources and modify them to display
                        images.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Non-emissive displays do not generate their own light. Instead, they modify an external
                                light source (such as backlight or ambient light) to create an image. Example: LCDs.
                            </li>

                <h3>Plasma Panel Display</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plasma Panel Displays, also called Gas-Discharge Displays, were an early type of flat-panel
                        display used before LCDs and OLEDs became popular. The name "Plasma" comes from the fact that
                        these displays use ionized gas (plasma) to produce light. Unlike traditional CRT screens that
                        rely on an electron beam, plasma displays use tiny gas-filled cells that light up when
                        electricity is applied.</li>
                    <li>A Plasma Panel Display is a self-emissive display that uses small gas-filled cells (pixels) to
                        create an image. When an electric current passes through these cells, the gas inside (usually
                        neon or xenon) gets ionized into plasma. This process emits light, which is used to form images
                        on the screen.</li>
                    <li>Plasma panels do not need constant refreshing like CRTs because once a pixel is lit, it stays on
                        until deliberately erased. This makes them flicker-free and stable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Key Components of a Plasma Panel Display</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cathode (Negative Electrode)</strong>: The cathode is a set of fine wires arranged
                        horizontally across the panel. These wires deliver a negative voltage to the gas cells, sending
                        electrical signals to different parts of the screen. They work together with the anode to
                        control which areas of the display light up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anode (Positive Electrode)</strong>: The anode consists of another set of wires, but
                        these are arranged vertically and carry a positive voltage. When combined with the cathode
                        wires, they form a grid-like structure, determining which gas cells are activated and producing
                        the required image on the screen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fluorescent Cells (Gas Pockets)</strong>: These tiny pockets of neon or xenon gas are
                        trapped between two glass plates. When voltage is applied, the gas ionizes into plasma and
                        begins to glow. This emitted light is what creates the bright and vibrant visuals on the plasma
                        display.</li>
                    <li><strong>Glass Plates</strong>: The plasma cells are enclosed between two glass plates, which act
                        as capacitors to maintain the voltage across the display. These plates help ensure the screen
                        stays illuminated properly and protect the internal components from external damage.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>How Does a Plasma Panel Display Work?</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, we have Grid Activation. Inside the plasma screen, there is a grid of cathode and anode
                        wires. The cathode wires run horizontally, and the anode wires run vertically. Each point where
                        these wires intersect represents a single pixel on the screen. When a voltage is applied to a
                        particular intersection, it activates that specific pixel, determining which part of the screen
                        lights up.</li>
                    <li>Next comes the Ionization of Gas. Within each pixel, there are tiny cells filled with neon or
                        xenon gas. When voltage is applied between a cathode and an anode, the gas inside that specific
                        cell ionizes into plasma. This means the gas is now charged and ready to emit energy.</li>
                    <li>Then, we have Light Emission. Once the gas is ionized, it emits ultraviolet (UV) light. However,
                        UV light is invisible to our eyes, so each plasma cell is coated with fluorescent phosphors.
                        These phosphors react to UV light and glow in one of three colors—Red, Green, or Blue (RGB). By
                        combining these colors in different intensities, the display creates a full range of colors,
                        producing clear and vibrant images.</li>
                    <li>Now, unlike older CRT screens, plasma displays offer a Stable Display Without Refreshing. This
                        means that once a pixel is lit, it stays illuminated as long as voltage is applied. CRT screens
                        need constant refreshing to maintain an image, but plasma displays hold their image steady,
                        reducing flicker and improving picture quality.</li>
                    <li>Finally, there’s the Erasing & Updating the Screen. When an image needs to change, the voltage
                        is lowered to around 90V, which stops the ionization process and turns off the pixel. Then, a
                        new voltage pattern is applied to activate different pixels, creating the next frame of the
                        image. This process happens extremely fast, allowing plasma displays to smoothly transition
                        between images, making them perfect for high-quality visuals.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Advantages of Plasma Panel Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Resolution</strong>: Plasma panels were capable of displaying sharp and detailed
                        images with good clarity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Large Screen Size Possible</strong>: Plasma technology allowed for bigger screens (up to
                        100 inches), making them popular for televisions and digital signage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Less Volume & Weight</strong>: Compared to bulky CRTs, plasma displays were thinner and
                        lighter, making them easier to mount on walls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flicker-Free Display</strong>: Since plasma displays do not require constant refreshing,
                        the images remain stable without flickering, reducing eye strain.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages of Plasma Panel Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Poor Resolution in Early Models</strong>: The first plasma panels had lower resolution
                        compared to modern LCDs and OLEDs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Wiring & Addressing</strong>: Since each pixel requires a dedicated cathode and
                        anode, plasma panels had a complex wiring system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Difficult to Control Addressing</strong>: Controlling and updating specific pixels in
                        plasma displays was technically challenging, making manufacturing more expensive.</li>

                <h3>Light Emitting Diode (LED) Display</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>LED displays are one of the most popular and widely used display technologies today. They are
                        known for their bright visuals, energy efficiency, and long lifespan. The name "LED" (Light
                        Emitting Diode) comes from the fact that these displays use small diodes that emit light when
                        electricity is passed through them.</li>
                    <li>An LED display is a flat-panel display that uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the source of
                        light. Unlike older display technologies like CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) and Plasma, LED displays
                        are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thinner</li>
                            <li>Brighter</li>
                            <li>More energy-efficient</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>LEDs are tiny semiconductor devices that emit light when an electric current passes through
                        them. These LEDs can be arranged in a grid to form images, text, or videos.</li>
                    <li>Even though we call them "LED displays," many LED TVs today are actually LCD displays with LED
                        backlighting rather than pure LED panels.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How Does an LED Display Work?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An LED Display creates images using tiny Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) that produce bright,
                        colorful visuals. </li>
                    <li>First, there’s Electric Current Activation . A small voltage is applied to each LED in the
                        display. This voltage excites the electrons inside the LED material, causing them to move to a
                        higher energy state. This is the first step in generating light.</li>
                    <li>Next comes Light Emission . Once the excited electrons return to their original energy state,
                        they release photons (light energy). The color of this emitted light depends on the material
                        used in the LED. For example, some LEDs emit Red, Green, or Blue (RGB) light, which are the
                        primary colors used to create images on the screen.</li>
                    <li>Then, we have Brightness & Color Control . The intensity of light from each LED is controlled
                        by adjusting the amount of electric current passing through it. By carefully controlling the
                        brightness of individual Red, Green, and Blue LEDs, the display can produce millions of colors,
                        creating a smooth and realistic image.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the LEDs work together for Image Formation . LEDs are arranged in a pixel grid, and
                        each pixel is made up of three tiny LEDs—one Red, one Green, and one Blue (called sub-pixels).
                        By adjusting the brightness levels of these sub-pixels, the screen can display a wide range of
                        colors, forming clear and vibrant images.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Advantages of LED Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong> High Brightness & Contrast</strong>: LED displays are brighter than LCDs and visible
                        even in daylight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Efficient</strong>: LEDs consume less power compared to older display
                        technologies like CRT and Plasma.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slim & Lightweight</strong>: LED displays are thinner and lighter, making them ideal for
                        wall-mounted TVs and portable devices.</li>
                    <li><strong> Long Lifespan</strong>: LEDs can last 50,000+ hours, much longer than traditional
                        fluorescent backlights.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Flickering, Less Eye Strain</strong>: Since LEDs refresh faster and do not flicker,
                        they reduce eye strain and provide a smoother viewing experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmentally Friendly</strong>: LEDs do not contain harmful mercury (unlike old CRTs
                        and CCFL backlights).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages of LED Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Higher Cost</strong>: Pure LED panels (like OLED & MicroLED) are expensive compared to
                        LCDs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Viewing Angle Issues (for some models)</strong>: Some LED-backlit LCDs have limited
                        viewing angles, making colors look distorted from the sides.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backlight Bleeding (for LED-backlit LCDs)</strong>: In LED-backlit LCDs, some light
                        leaks around the edges, reducing contrast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shorter Lifespan for Certain Colors</strong>: Blue LEDs tend to degrade faster, leading
                        to color shifts over time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Where Are LED Displays Used?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>TVs & Monitors – LED-backlit LCDs are used in most modern televisions and computer screens.</li>
                    <li>Smartphones & Tablets – Most phones today use LED-backlit LCDs or OLED screens.</li>
                    <li> Outdoor Billboards – Large LED panels are used for advertising displays.</li>
                    <li> Traffic Lights & Signboards – LEDs are used in traffic signals and digital road signs.</li>
                    <li> Theater & Stage Displays – Concerts and events use large LED video walls.</li>
                    <li> Wearable Devices – Smartwatches and fitness trackers often use OLED (a type of LED display).

                <h3>Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is one of the most common display technologies used in devices like
                        televisions, computer monitors, smartphones, and more. It's known for its thin profile, good
                        image quality, and energy efficiency. However, unlike LED displays, LCDs don’t emit their own
                        light—they rely on a backlight to illuminate the display.</li>
                    <li>An LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) uses liquid crystals to form images. These liquid crystals don't
                        emit light directly, but instead, they manipulate light from a backlight source to produce
                        images.</li>
                    <li>The LCD screen’s "liquid crystal" doesn't mean it’s a liquid like water; it’s a special
                        substance that has properties of both liquids and solids, allowing it to adjust its transparency
                        when electricity is applied.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An LCD Display works by manipulating light to create vibrant images. </li>
                    <li>First, there’s the Backlight. To get the display to shine, an LED or fluorescent light is used
                        to shine through the LCD panel. This provides the necessary light for the display to work, as
                        the liquid crystals themselves don’t emit light.</li>
                    <li>Next, we have Liquid Crystals. These are special materials that can manipulate light when an
                        electric current is applied. When voltage is passed through them, the liquid crystals change
                        their alignment, controlling how light passes through them and allowing the display to produce
                        different shades.</li>
                    <li>Finally, there are Color Filters. The LCD uses filters to create the three primary colors—Red,
                        Green, and Blue—by manipulating the light passing through the liquid crystals. These colors mix
                        in different intensities to create a full spectrum of colors and form the image we see on the
                        screen.</li>
                    <li>And that’s how it works—using a backlight, liquid crystals, and color filters to produce images
                        with vibrant colors and sharp detail!</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Advantages of LCD Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Thin and Lightweight</strong>: LCDs are thinner and lighter compared to older CRTs,
                        making them easier to mount on walls or fit into compact spaces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Efficient</strong>: LCDs are much more energy-efficient compared to older display
                        technologies like CRT and Plasma.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Brightness</strong>: Bright visuals, making them ideal for use in well-lit
                        environments or even outdoors.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Flickering</strong>: Stable image with no flicker, which reduces eye strain during
                        prolonged usage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Good Color Accuracy</strong>: With modern advancements, LCDs now offer excellent color
                        reproduction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Long Lifespan</strong>: Long-lasting displays that can function well for 50,000 hours or
                        more.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Disadvantages of LCD Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Limited Viewing Angles</strong>: Color distortion can occur when viewed from an angle,
                        especially with older or cheaper LCDs. This is improved in IPS (In-Plane Switching) displays.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Lower Contrast Ratios</strong>: Compared to OLED and plasma displays, LCDs generally
                        have lower contrast ratios, which means blacks can appear greyish instead of deep black.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backlight Bleeding</strong>: Some LCDs (especially cheaper models) can have backlight
                        bleed, where light leaks around the edges or corners, affecting picture quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slower Response Times</strong>: Faster-moving images (like sports or action scenes) may
                        appear blurry on TN displays with slower response times.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Applications of LCD Displays</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Televisions & Monitors</strong>: LCD TVs are very common for home entertainment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smartphones & Tablets</strong>: Most smartphones use IPS LCDs for vibrant color and good
                        viewing angles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Laptop Screens</strong>: Thin and lightweight, making them perfect for portable
                        computers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Watches & Clocks</strong>: Low power consumption and simple designs make LCD
                        ideal for portable, battery-operated devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automotive Displays</strong>: LCDs are used in dashboard screens and in-car navigation.
