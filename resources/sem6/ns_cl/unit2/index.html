        <h1>Security in Network Protocols</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>In today’s digital world, securing data during communication is crucial. Whether we are making online
                transactions, sending emails, or accessing websites, sensitive information is constantly being exchanged
                over the internet. Cyber threats such as hacking, phishing, and data interception pose serious risks,
                making security at different layers of communication essential.</li>

            <li>In today’s digital world, securing data during communication is crucial. Whether we are making online
                transactions, sending emails, or accessing websites, sensitive information is constantly being exchanged
                over the internet. Cyber threats such as hacking, phishing, and data interception pose serious risks,
                making security at different layers of communication essential.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Application Layer Security deals with securing specific applications like email and online
                    transactions. Protocols such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and S/MIME are used to secure email
                    communications, ensuring that messages remain confidential and authentic. Similarly, the SET (Secure
                    Electronic Transaction) protocol helps protect online transactions by securing credit card details
                    and payment information.</li>
                <li>Transport Layer Security focuses on securing data during transmission over the internet. The SSL
                    (Secure Socket Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols provide encryption and
                    authentication for secure web browsing, online banking, and other internet services. Additionally,
                    Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS) extends these protections to wireless networks, ensuring
                    secure communication in mobile and IoT environments.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Together, these security mechanisms form a multi-layered defense against cyber threats, ensuring data
                integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity during communication. Understanding these protocols and
                their implementations is key to securing modern network applications.</li>

            <h2>Application Layer Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Imagine you’re sending an important email, making an online payment, or logging into your favorite
                    social media site. Ever wondered what keeps your sensitive information safe from hackers? That’s
                    where Application Layer Security comes in!</li>
                <li>The application layer is the topmost layer in a network, handling how users interact with
                    applications like web browsers, email clients, and online banking systems. But since this is where
                    data is entered, sent, and received, it’s also the layer most exposed to cyber threats like
                    phishing, data theft, and man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
                <li>To keep this layer secure, different security mechanisms and protocols are used:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) helps protect online payments and credit card
                            transactions.</li>
                        <li>Email security protocols like PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and S/MIME encrypt emails to keep
                            them private and authentic.</li>
                        <li>Countermeasures against threats ensure that sensitive information is protected from
                            unauthorized access.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>By implementing strong security measures at the application layer, we can protect our data from
                    cyberattacks, ensuring safe and trustworthy online interactions.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">

                <h3>Security Threats in the Application Layer</h3>

                <p>
                    The <strong>application layer</strong> is where users interact with software applications like web
                    browsers, messaging apps, and emails.
                    Since this layer deals directly with users and data, hackers love to target it! Instead of attacking
                    deeper technical layers,
                    they try to exploit the software you use every day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Attackers often send harmful software through emails, messages, or fake websites, tricking users
                    into opening them.
                    Once inside, these malicious programs can steal data, modify records, or even control an entire
                    system.
                    That’s why understanding security threats in the application layer is crucial.
                </p>

                <h3>Common Security Threats at the Application Layer</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Injection Attacks (SQL Injection & Cross-Site Scripting)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Security Misconfigurations</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1. Injection Attacks (SQL Injection & Cross-Site Scripting)</h3>

                <p>
                    Imagine you're logging into a website, and instead of a normal username, a hacker enters a special
                    piece of code.
                    If the website isn’t secured properly, the hacker's code can sneak into the system and do things
                    like viewing confidential data,
                    modifying records, or even deleting information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, an attack where an attacker <strong>injects harmful code into an application</strong> to
                    manipulate or steal data is known as an
                    <strong>injection attack</strong>. The two common types are:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> Attackers insert malicious SQL commands into database queries,
                        allowing them to
                        steal, modify, or delete sensitive data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> Hackers inject scripts into websites that later run
                        in a user’s browser,
                        potentially stealing login credentials or personal information.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h3>

                <p>
                    Think about clicking on a link that automatically changes your email password without you even
                    realizing it.
                    Sounds scary, right? That’s exactly what a <strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong> attack
                    does.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, an attack where a hacker <strong>tricks users into making unwanted actions on a website</strong>
                    where they are already logged in
                    is called <strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong>. This can be used to transfer money,
                    change account details, or perform other
                    actions without the user’s consent.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Security Misconfigurations</h3>

                <p>
                    Have you ever left your phone unlocked and someone played a prank on you? That’s similar to what
                    happens in
                    <strong>security misconfigurations</strong>. If developers forget to secure an application properly,
                    hackers can take advantage of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, a situation where <strong>security settings are not configured properly</strong>, allowing
                    attackers to exploit weaknesses,
                    is called <strong>security misconfiguration</strong>. Common mistakes include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Using default usernames and passwords (like "admin" and "password").</li>
                    <li>Leaving unnecessary features enabled, which hackers can exploit.</li>
                    <li>Not updating software, making it vulnerable to known security issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks</h3>

                <p>
                    Imagine trying to enter a store, but a huge crowd is blocking the entrance, preventing real
                    customers from getting inside.
                    That’s what a <strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attack</strong> does to websites and applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, an attack where <strong>hackers flood a system with fake traffic</strong> to overload it and
                    make it unavailable to real users
                    is called a <strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attack</strong>. If multiple infected computers are used
                    to attack, it's called a
                    <strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</h3>

                <p>
                    A <strong>zero-day vulnerability</strong> is like a hidden crack in a locked door that no one has
                    noticed yet; not even the owner.
                    Hackers find these security gaps before developers do and exploit them before a fix is available.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, a security flaw that <strong>is unknown to developers and does not yet have a fix</strong> is
                    called a
                    <strong>zero-day vulnerability</strong>. Hackers exploit these weaknesses before they are patched,
                    making them highly dangerous.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Countermeasures to Mitigate Security Risks</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we know about the common security threats in the application layer, let’s talk about how we
                    can protect ourselves from these dangers.
                    Countermeasures are like safety measures we put in place to reduce or eliminate the risks posed by
                    cyberattacks.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input Validation and Sanitization:</strong> Ensures that only the right kind of data is
                        accepted from users, blocking harmful input like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Authentication verifies the identity of
                        users, while authorization ensures users can only access the resources they’re permitted to.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Communication Protocols:</strong> Protocols like HTTPS encrypt data to prevent
                        attackers from intercepting sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Patching and Updates:</strong> Keeping software updated ensures that any known
                        vulnerabilities are patched, reducing the risk of exploitation by attackers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong> Firewalls block unauthorized
                        access, while IDS alerts administrators to suspicious activity, helping prevent breaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Training for Users:</strong> Educating users on safe practices, such as
                        recognizing phishing attempts and avoiding malware, can prevent many attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):</strong> Incorporates security from the
                        start of the development process, continuously testing the application for vulnerabilities as
                        it’s being built.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>SET (Secure Electronic Transaction)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you enter your credit card details on an online shopping site, have you ever thought about
                        how they stay safe? What if someone intercepts your payment information while it’s being
                        transmitted? That’s where Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) comes in!</li>
                    <li>SET is a security protocol designed specifically for securing online credit card transactions.
                        Since online payments happen through web applications, they operate at the application layer of
                        the network. This is the same layer where we use email, browsers, and online services; making it
                        a major target for cyber threats. If this layer isn't secured properly, attackers can steal
                        sensitive data like card details, passwords, and personal information.</li>
                    <li>To prevent such threats, SET ensures that credit card payments remain encrypted and secure
                        during transmission. It does this using:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Encryption – Protects payment details so only authorized parties can read them.</li>
                            <li>Authentication – Verifies both the buyer and the seller to prevent fraud.</li>
                            <li>Digital Signatures – Ensures that transactions cannot be tampered with.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>By implementing SET at the application layer, we can secure financial transactions directly at
                        the source, preventing hackers from intercepting sensitive payment information. While SET itself
                        was not widely adopted due to its complexity, its security principles are still used in modern
                        online payment systems like 3D Secure (used by Visa & Mastercard), PayPal encryption, and
                        banking security protocols.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How SET Ensures Secure Transactions</h3>
                <p>Now that we know SET (Secure Electronic Transaction) is designed to protect online credit card
                    transactions, let’s see how it actually keeps payments secure. Unlike simple encryption methods, SET
                    provides a multi-layered security approach to ensure that transactions remain private, authentic,
                    and tamper-proof.</p>
                <p><strong>Here’s how SET ensures secure transactions:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Encryption of Payment Information :
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you enter your credit card details, SET encrypts them so that no one; including the
                                merchant; can see them.</li>
                            <li>Only the bank or payment processor can decrypt and process the payment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Digital Certificates for Authentication :
                        <ul>
                            <li>Both the buyer and the merchant have digital certificates issued by a trusted authority
                                (like Visa or Mastercard).</li>
                            <li>This ensures that both parties are verified and legitimate, reducing fraud risks.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Dual Signature for Data Integrity :
                        <ul>
                            <li>SET uses a dual signature mechanism, which means:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The merchant can only see order details (but not your payment info).</li>
                                    <li>The bank can only see payment details (but not what you purchased).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>This way, your financial data stays private while ensuring a secure transaction.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Authentication of All Parties :
                        <ul>
                            <li>SET verifies the identity of all participants in the transaction before processing the
                                payment.</li>
                            <li>This prevents unauthorized users from making fraudulent purchases.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Prevention of Replay Attacks :
                        <ul>
                            <li>SET ensures that each transaction is unique and cannot be reused by attackers.</li>
                            <li>This prevents hackers from intercepting and resending payment requests.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Together, these steps make SET a strong security framework for online payments. Even though SET
                    itself isn’t widely used today, its security principles are the foundation of modern online payment
                    systems.</p>
                <h3>Applications and Use Cases of SET</h3>

                <p>SET was specifically designed for secure online transactions, and while it wasn’t widely adopted due
                    to its complexity, it paved the way for today’s payment security technologies. Here’s where SET (or
                    its concepts) have been applied:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>E-commerce Websites</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>SET was originally developed for secure online shopping, ensuring that credit card
                                transactions remain encrypted and verified.</li>
                            <li>Today, platforms like Amazon, eBay, and online banking systems use security methods
                                based on SET principles.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Online Banking & Digital Wallets</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Many online banking platforms use encryption and authentication techniques similar to
                                SET to protect transactions.</li>
                            <li>Services like PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay use encryption, authentication, and
                                secure tokenization, inspired by SET.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>3D Secure (Visa Secure, Mastercard SecureCode, etc.)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Modern payment security protocols like 3D Secure (used in Visa, Mastercard, and RuPay
                                transactions) use multi-factor authentication and encryption; key elements of SET.</li>
                            <li>These methods verify the user before completing the payment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Secure Government and Corporate Transactions</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Government agencies and financial institutions use SET-like encryption and
                                authentication when handling sensitive transactions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Even though SET itself didn’t become the global standard, its encryption, authentication, and
                    verification methods continue to shape the way we secure digital transactions today.</p>

                <h3> Electronic Mail Security</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sending emails is something we all do daily; whether it’s for work, personal communication, or even online shopping updates. But have you ever thought about how secure those emails are? Since email is one of the most widely used communication tools, it’s also a primary target for cyber threats like phishing, unauthorized access, and data theft.</li>
                    <li>
                        Electronic Mail Security focuses on protecting the content of emails, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. It’s crucial because an insecure email system can lead to data breaches, identity theft, and fraud. Just imagine receiving a phishing email that looks just like a legitimate bank request; without proper security measures, you might fall for it.
                    </li>  
                    <li>To prevent such threats, several security protocols and technologies have been developed:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Encryption protects the content of the email so only the intended recipient can read it.</li>
                            <li>Digital Signatures verify the identity of the sender, ensuring the email hasn’t been tampered with.</li>
                            <li>Authentication protocols like SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) help verify that the sender is who they claim to be.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>       
                    <li>By ensuring emails are securely transmitted, we can protect sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized parties. Let’s dive into how these email security protocols work and how they help keep your messages safe!</li>
