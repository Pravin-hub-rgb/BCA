        <h1>Security in Network Protocols</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>In today’s digital world, securing data during communication is crucial. Whether we are making online
                transactions, sending emails, or accessing websites, sensitive information is constantly being exchanged
                over the internet. Cyber threats such as hacking, phishing, and data interception pose serious risks,
                making security at different layers of communication essential.</li>

            <li>In today’s digital world, securing data during communication is crucial. Whether we are making online
                transactions, sending emails, or accessing websites, sensitive information is constantly being exchanged
                over the internet. Cyber threats such as hacking, phishing, and data interception pose serious risks,
                making security at different layers of communication essential.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Application Layer Security deals with securing specific applications like email and online
                    transactions. Protocols such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and S/MIME are used to secure email
                    communications, ensuring that messages remain confidential and authentic. Similarly, the SET (Secure
                    Electronic Transaction) protocol helps protect online transactions by securing credit card details
                    and payment information.</li>
                <li>Transport Layer Security focuses on securing data during transmission over the internet. The SSL
                    (Secure Socket Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols provide encryption and
                    authentication for secure web browsing, online banking, and other internet services. Additionally,
                    Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS) extends these protections to wireless networks, ensuring
                    secure communication in mobile and IoT environments.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Together, these security mechanisms form a multi-layered defense against cyber threats, ensuring data
                integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity during communication. Understanding these protocols and
                their implementations is key to securing modern network applications.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Application Layer Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Imagine you’re sending an important email, making an online payment, or logging into your favorite
                    social media site. Ever wondered what keeps your sensitive information safe from hackers? That’s
                    where Application Layer Security comes in!</li>
                <li>The application layer is the topmost layer in a network, handling how users interact with
                    applications like web browsers, email clients, and online banking systems. But since this is where
                    data is entered, sent, and received, it’s also the layer most exposed to cyber threats like
                    phishing, data theft, and man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
                <li>To keep this layer secure, different security mechanisms and protocols are used:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) helps protect online payments and credit card
                            transactions.</li>
                        <li>Email security protocols like PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and S/MIME encrypt emails to keep
                            them private and authentic.</li>
                        <li>Countermeasures against threats ensure that sensitive information is protected from
                            unauthorized access.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>By implementing strong security measures at the application layer, we can protect our data from
                    cyberattacks, ensuring safe and trustworthy online interactions.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">

                <h3>Security Threats in the Application Layer</h3>

                <p>
                    The <strong>application layer</strong> is where users interact with software applications like web
                    browsers, messaging apps, and emails.
                    Since this layer deals directly with users and data, hackers love to target it! Instead of attacking
                    deeper technical layers,
                    they try to exploit the software you use every day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Attackers often send harmful software through emails, messages, or fake websites, tricking users
                    into opening them.
                    Once inside, these malicious programs can steal data, modify records, or even control an entire
                    system.
                    That’s why understanding security threats in the application layer is crucial.
                </p>

                <h3>Common Security Threats at the Application Layer</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Injection Attacks (SQL Injection & Cross-Site Scripting)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Security Misconfigurations</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1. Injection Attacks (SQL Injection & Cross-Site Scripting)</h3>

                <p>
                    Imagine you're logging into a website, and instead of a normal username, a hacker enters a special
                    piece of code.
                    If the website isn’t secured properly, the hacker's code can sneak into the system and do things
                    like viewing confidential data,
                    modifying records, or even deleting information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, an attack where an attacker <strong>injects harmful code into an application</strong> to
                    manipulate or steal data is known as an
                    <strong>injection attack</strong>. The two common types are:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> Attackers insert malicious SQL commands into database queries,
                        allowing them to
                        steal, modify, or delete sensitive data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> Hackers inject scripts into websites that later run
                        in a user’s browser,
                        potentially stealing login credentials or personal information.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h3>

                <p>
                    Think about clicking on a link that automatically changes your email password without you even
                    realizing it.
                    Sounds scary, right? That’s exactly what a <strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong> attack
                    does.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, an attack where a hacker <strong>tricks users into making unwanted actions on a website</strong>
                    where they are already logged in
                    is called <strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong>. This can be used to transfer money,
                    change account details, or perform other
                    actions without the user’s consent.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Security Misconfigurations</h3>

                <p>
                    Have you ever left your phone unlocked and someone played a prank on you? That’s similar to what
                    happens in
                    <strong>security misconfigurations</strong>. If developers forget to secure an application properly,
                    hackers can take advantage of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, a situation where <strong>security settings are not configured properly</strong>, allowing
                    attackers to exploit weaknesses,
                    is called <strong>security misconfiguration</strong>. Common mistakes include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Using default usernames and passwords (like "admin" and "password").</li>
                    <li>Leaving unnecessary features enabled, which hackers can exploit.</li>
                    <li>Not updating software, making it vulnerable to known security issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks</h3>

                <p>
                    Imagine trying to enter a store, but a huge crowd is blocking the entrance, preventing real
                    customers from getting inside.
                    That’s what a <strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attack</strong> does to websites and applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, an attack where <strong>hackers flood a system with fake traffic</strong> to overload it and
                    make it unavailable to real users
                    is called a <strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attack</strong>. If multiple infected computers are used
                    to attack, it's called a
                    <strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</h3>

                <p>
                    A <strong>zero-day vulnerability</strong> is like a hidden crack in a locked door that no one has
                    noticed yet—not even the owner.
                    Hackers find these security gaps before developers do and exploit them before a fix is available.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, a security flaw that <strong>is unknown to developers and does not yet have a fix</strong> is
                    called a
                    <strong>zero-day vulnerability</strong>. Hackers exploit these weaknesses before they are patched,
                    making them highly dangerous.
