        <h1>Security in Network Protocols</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>In today’s digital world, securing data during communication is crucial. Whether we are making online transactions, sending emails, or accessing websites, sensitive information is constantly being exchanged over the internet. Cyber threats such as hacking, phishing, and data interception pose serious risks, making security at different layers of communication essential.</li>

            <li>In today’s digital world, securing data during communication is crucial. Whether we are making online transactions, sending emails, or accessing websites, sensitive information is constantly being exchanged over the internet. Cyber threats such as hacking, phishing, and data interception pose serious risks, making security at different layers of communication essential.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Application Layer Security deals with securing specific applications like email and online transactions. Protocols such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and S/MIME are used to secure email communications, ensuring that messages remain confidential and authentic. Similarly, the SET (Secure Electronic Transaction) protocol helps protect online transactions by securing credit card details and payment information.</li>
                <li>Transport Layer Security focuses on securing data during transmission over the internet. The SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols provide encryption and authentication for secure web browsing, online banking, and other internet services. Additionally, Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS) extends these protections to wireless networks, ensuring secure communication in mobile and IoT environments.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Together, these security mechanisms form a multi-layered defense against cyber threats, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity during communication. Understanding these protocols and their implementations is key to securing modern network applications.</li>
        </ul>
