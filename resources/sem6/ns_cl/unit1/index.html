        <h1>Introduction to Network security</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Network Security is the practice of protecting a computer network and its resources from unauthorized
                access, cyberattacks, and data breaches. It ensures that only authorized users can access information
                while keeping data confidential, intact, and available.</li>
            <li>In simple words, Network Security is like a protective shield that safeguards computers, devices, and
                data from cyber threats.</li>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why is Network Security Important?</strong>
        <ul class="lstn">
            <li>ðŸ“Œ <strong>Protects Sensitive Data</strong> â€“ Ensures that personal and business data is safe from
                cybercriminals.</li>
            <li>ðŸ“Œ <strong>Prevents Unauthorized Access</strong> â€“ Only trusted users can access private networks.</li>
            <li>ðŸ“Œ <strong>Ensures Data Integrity</strong> â€“ Prevents hackers from modifying important information.</li>
            <li>ðŸ“Œ <strong>Maintains Network Availability</strong> â€“ Stops attacks that can crash or disrupt services.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Example: If a hacker gains access to an online banking system, they could:
        <ul>
            <li>Steal customer login details.</li>
            <li>Transfer money illegally.</li>
            <li>Leak sensitive financial data.</li>
        </ul>
        Network security prevents these threats and keeps systems safe and functional.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Common Threats in Network Security</strong></p>
        <ul class="lstn">
            <li><strong>ðŸ”¹ Unauthorized Access</strong> â€“ Hackers breaking into a system without permission.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: Guessing or stealing passwords to log into someoneâ€™s account.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Malware (Viruses, Worms, Trojans, Ransomware)</strong> â€“ Malicious programs that harm or
                control systems.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: A virus that corrupts important files and makes them unusable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Phishing Attacks</strong> â€“ Fake emails/websites tricking users into sharing sensitive data.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: A fake email pretending to be from a bank, asking for login details.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks</strong> â€“ Overloading a website or system to make it crash.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: A hacker sending thousands of fake requests to a website, making it unavailable for
                        real users.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks</strong> â€“ A hacker intercepting and altering communication
                between two users.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: An attacker spying on an online shopping transaction and stealing credit card details.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How Network Security Works (Protective Measures)</strong></p>
        <ul class="lstn">
            <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Firewalls</strong> â€“ Work like security guards, blocking harmful traffic.</li>
            <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Encryption</strong> â€“ Converts data into unreadable code to keep it safe.</li>
            <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong> â€“ Adds an extra verification step before login.</li>
            <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</strong> â€“ Encrypts internet traffic for secure browsing.
            </li>
            <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Antivirus & Anti-malware</strong> â€“ Detects and removes malicious software.</li>
        </ul>

                <h2>Goals of Network Security</h2>
                <p>Network security aims to protect data and systems from threats. Its main goals are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Keeping data private and ensuring only authorized access. For
                        example, using encryption to secure passwords.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered. Hashing techniques help
                        maintain data accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring systems are always accessible. Network security prevents
                        DDoS attacks that cause downtime.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Verifying identity before granting access. This is like showing
                        an ID before entering a building, often enhanced with two-factor authentication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-repudiation:</strong> Ensuring actions can't be denied. Digital signatures and logs
                        provide proof of transactions.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="wh extended">
                <h2>Goals of Network Security</h2>
                <p>When we talk about network security, itâ€™s not just about putting up firewalls or installing antivirus
                    software. The ultimate aim is to achieve specific goals that ensure your data and systems remain
                    safe
                    and functional. Think of network security like a castle's defense systemâ€”it's not just about
                    building
                    walls, but about protecting the kingdom in several different ways.
                    <br>So, what are the goals of network security?:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Confidentiality is about keeping sensitive data private and
                        ensuring that only authorized people have access to it. The idea is to prevent anyone (hackers,
                        unauthorized employees, etc.) from viewing or accessing private information.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Just like you wouldnâ€™t want someone snooping through your personal documents or stealing
                                your password, businesses and individuals need to make sure that sensitive
                                informationâ€”like
                                financial records, customer details, or trade secretsâ€”stay hidden from unwanted eyes.
                            </li>
                            <li>Imagine you're sending a password to someone through email. Without proper security, a
                                hacker could intercept the message and steal the password. Using encryption, you make
                                sure
                                that even if someone intercepts the email, the password is unreadable to them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Integrity ensures that the data being transmitted or stored is
                        accurate
                        and has not been altered by unauthorized individuals. It means that the data you send or store
                        is
                        the same as when it was created or shared, without tampering.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Imagine youâ€™re ordering a product online. What if someone changed the quantity or price
                                of
                                the item during the transaction? Youâ€™d end up paying more or receiving the wrong
                                product.
                                Integrity ensures that this doesnâ€™t happen, protecting the accuracy of your information.
                            </li>
                            <li>During a financial transaction, if a hacker changes the amount being transferred from
                                your
                                account, that would be an integrity breach. By using techniques like hashing (to check
                                data
                                integrity), systems can ensure data is not tampered with.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Availability means that the network, systems, and data are always
                        accessible when needed. Itâ€™s about making sure that legitimate users can always access the
                        resources
                        they require, without interruptions or downtime.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Imagine a hospitalâ€™s computer system crashes during an emergency. That would be
                                catastrophic. Whether itâ€™s cloud storage, business applications, or even websites,
                                availability is crucial for business operations and user trust.</li>
                            <li>In a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, hackers flood a website with so many
                                requests that the site becomes unavailable. Network security prevents such attacks,
                                ensuring
                                that websites, systems, and apps remain available to their users.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Authentication is the process of verifying who you are before
                        granting access to a network or system. Think of it like showing your ID card before entering a
                        building. It ensures that only authorized users can access resources.
                        <ul>
                            <li>You donâ€™t want just anyone logging into your bank account or accessing your personal
                                files.
                                Authentication is the first line of defense against unauthorized access.</li>
                            <li>When you log in to a website using your username and password, thatâ€™s authentication in
                                action. To strengthen it, many websites also use two-factor authentication (2FA), where
                                you
                                get a code on your phone to prove itâ€™s really you trying to log in.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Non-repudiation:</strong> Non-repudiation means that once something is done, it canâ€™t be
                        denied. It ensures that someone cannot deny their actions or the authenticity of the data.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you make an online purchase, you want to be sure that the transaction is legitimate.
                                Non-repudiation guarantees that thereâ€™s evidence proving the action took place, such as
                                logs
                                or signatures.</li>
                            <li>If a company makes a financial transfer, the transaction is logged with digital
                                signatures
                                to prove that the transfer was legitimate and authorized. This prevents someone from
                                saying,
                                "I didnâ€™t make that payment," even if they did.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>OSI Security Architecture (Also Referred to as ISO Security Architecture)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Security is a critical aspect of any networked system. The OSI Security Architecture, defined by ISO
                    (International Organization for Standardization), outlines how security threats are categorized,
                    what mechanisms are used to prevent or mitigate them, and what services ensure a secure
                    communication environment.</li>

                <li>The reason it is sometimes called <strong>ISO Security Architecture</strong> is because the OSI
                    (Open Systems Interconnection) model itself was developed by ISO. Since ISO is the organization that
                    defined this security framework, some materials refer to it as "ISO Security Architecture." However,
                    the correct and widely used term is <strong>OSI Security Architecture</strong>, as it specifically
                    applies to securing network communication under the OSI model.</li>

                <li>Imagine you own a house. You lock the doors to keep it safe, but what if the lock is weak? Or what
                    if a thief doesnâ€™t even try to break the lock and instead enters through a window? Thatâ€™s exactly
                    how security works in the digital world too! No matter how strong one aspect of security is, there
                    can always be another weak spot that attackers exploit.</li>
            </ul>

                            <li>Your Wi-Fi network at home has no password. Even if no one has hacked it yet, the
                                possibility of someone stealing your internet or spying on your online activity is a
                                threat.</li>

                            <li>An attack is a deliberate attempt to compromise a systemâ€™s security by exploiting a
                                vulnerability.</li>
                            <li>If a hacker connects to your unprotected Wi-Fi, intercepts your network traffic, and
                                steals your personal information, this is an attack.</li>

                            <li>Defacement of servers (hacking and changing websites to spread messages or
                                misinformation)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>There are two main types of security attacks:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Passive Attacks â€“ The attacker secretly monitors or eavesdrops on data.</li>
                            <li>Active Attacks â€“ The attacker modifies, disrupts, or creates false data.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Passive Attack</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A passive attack is when an attacker quietly listens in or monitors communication without
                        making any changes.</li>
                    <li>Key Features of Passive Attacks:
                        <ul class="lstn">
                            <li>âœ” No changes to the data</li>
                            <li>âœ” Only reading, observing, or eavesdropping</li>
                            <li>âœ” Hard to detect because nothing is altered</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Imagine two friends, Bob and Alice, chatting. A hacker named Darth secretly listens to their
                        conversation but doesnâ€™t interfere. Thatâ€™s a passive attack.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Types of Passive Attacks
                <ol>
                    <li>Release of Message Contents: The attacker reads confidential information being
                        exchanged.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You send a private email to your bank, and a hacker secretly reads it.</li>
                                    <li>A spy listens to a secret phone call between two diplomats.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Prevention:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Encryption â€“ If Bob encrypts his message before sending it, Darth wonâ€™t be
                                        able to read it.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Traffic Analysis: Even if data is encrypted, the attacker can still learn who is talking to
                        whom, how often, and for how long.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A hacker sees that a CEO and CFO of a company are emailing each other
                                        frequently, even though the emails are encrypted. This might indicate an
                                        important financial deal.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Prevention:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Using VPNs or Tor Networks â€“ These hide communication patterns.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>Active Attacks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>An active attack is when an attacker modifies data, disrupts communication, or creates fake
                        messages.</li>
                    <li>Key Features of Active Attacks:
                        <ul class="lstn">
                            <li>âœ” Data is changed, deleted, or inserted</li>
                            <li>âœ” More harmful than passive attacks</li>
                            <li>âœ” Easier to detect but harder to prevent</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Letâ€™s look at the four main types of active attacks.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Masquerade Attack (Impersonation)</strong>: The attacker pretends to be someone else to
                        gain unauthorized
                        access.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A hacker steals your login credentials and logs into your account as you.</li>
                                    <li>An attacker sends a fake email pretending to be your bank, asking for your
                                        password.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Prevention: Two-factor authentication (2FA) â€“ Even if a hacker steals your password,
                                they wonâ€™t be able to log in without the second security check.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Replay Attack (Copy-Paste Attack)</strong>: The attacker captures a legitimate message
                        and sends it again to trick the recipient.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You send a message: "Transfer â‚¹10,000 to Alice."</li>
                                    <li>The attacker records this message and sends it again later, causing a second
                                        transaction without your permission.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Prevention: Use timestamps and session tokens â€“ This prevents old messages from being
                                replayed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Modification of Messages (Message Tampering)</strong>: The attacker alters a message
                        before it reaches the recipient.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Bob sends a message: "Allow John to access the files."</li>
                                    <li>Darth intercepts it and changes it to "Allow Tim to access the files."</li>
                                    <li>Now, the wrong person gets access!</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Prevention: Digital signatures â€“ This ensures messages arenâ€™t altered during
                                transmission.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS Attack)</strong>: The attacker overloads a system so that real
                        users canâ€™t access it.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A hacker floods a website with too many requests, making it crash.</li>
                                    <li>A spam bot sends thousands of login attempts, preventing real users from logging
                                        in.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Prevention: Firewalls and rate-limiting â€“ These detect and block unusual traffic.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Differences Between Passive and Active Attacks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Passive attacks just observe the communication without making any changes, while on the other
                        hand, active attacks modify or disrupt the data.</li>
                    <li>Passive attacks are less harmful as they only gather information, whereas active attacks are
                        more harmful as they can alter or damage data.</li>
                    <li>Passive attacks are hard to detect because they do not interfere with the system, whereas active
                        attacks are easier to detect due to noticeable disruptions.</li>
                    <li>An example of a passive attack is eavesdropping on a network, while an example of an active
                        attack is hacking and modifying data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Security Services</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A security service is a feature that protects data and ensures secure communication between
                        users or systems.</li>
                    <li>Why are they important?
                        <ul class="lstn">
                            <li>âœ” Prevents unauthorized access</li>
                            <li>âœ” Ensures data remains private</li>
                            <li>âœ” Maintains trust and authenticity in communication</li>
                            <li>âœ” Protects against cyberattacks and fraud</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Security services are provided by a secured system to ensure safe and reliable communication.
                    </li>
                    <li>Types of Security Services: There are six major security services that help in securing data and
                        communication:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Authentication
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Peer Entity Authentication</li>
                                    <li>Data Origin Authentication</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Access Control</li>
                            <li>Data Confidentiality</li>
                            <li>Data Integrity</li>
                            <li>Non-Repudiation</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>1: Authentication (Verifying Identity)</strong></p>
                <p>Authentication ensures that the sender and receiver are who they claim to be. It prevents imposters
                    from accessing sensitive information.
                    <br>There are two types of authentication:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Peer Entity Authentication (Real-Time Verification)</strong>: This verifies that the
                        entity you are communicating with is genuine during an ongoing session.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When you log into a banking website, the system continuously checks whether you
                                        are still the same user and havenâ€™t been replaced by a hacker.</li>
                                    <li>Two devices connected over a network verify each otherâ€™s identity in real-time.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Protection Methods: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra security</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Origin Authentication (Verifying the Sender)</strong>: This confirms who sent the
                        data, ensuring that the message actually comes from the claimed sender and not an attacker.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You receive an email from your bank. This service ensures that the email really
                                        came from the bank and not a scammer.</li>
                                    <li>A digital signature on a document proves that it was sent by the correct sender.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Protection Methods:
                                Digital signatures and cryptographic verification</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>2: Access Control (Who Can Access What?)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access control restricts who can access data and what they can do with it.</li>
                    <li>Example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A companyâ€™s HR system allows only HR employees to view salary data.</li>
                            <li>Your cloud storage (like Google Drive) lets you decide who can view, edit, or download
                                your files.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Protection Methods:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) â€“ Users are assigned permissions based on their role.
                            </li>
                            <li>User authentication (passwords, biometrics, etc.)</li>
                        </ul>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>3: Data Confidentiality (Keeping Data Private)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Confidentiality ensures that only authorized users can read the data. Even if hackers steal the
                        data, they wonâ€™t be able to understand it without proper decryption.</li>
                    <li>Example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you send a WhatsApp message, it is encrypted, meaning only the recipient can read
                                it.</li>
                            <li>A secured website (HTTPS) ensures your credit card details are protected while shopping
                                online.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Protection Methods:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Encryption â€“ Converts data into unreadable format (e.g., AES, RSA).</li>
                            <li></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>4: Data Integrity (Ensuring Data is Not Tampered)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integrity ensures that the data remains unchanged during transmission. If someone tries to
                        modify the data, the receiver can detect it.</li>
                    <li>Example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you download software from an official website, a checksum (hash value) verifies that
                                it has not been altered by hackers.</li>
                            <li>A bank transaction ensures that the transferred amount is not changed by an attacker in
                                transit.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Protection Methods: Hash functions (SHA-256, MD5) â€“ Create a unique fingerprint for data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>5: Non-Repudiation (No Denying Later)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This prevents the sender from denying that they sent a message or transaction. It provides proof
                        that an action was taken by a specific user.</li>
                    <li>Example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A person sends an email and later denies sending it> Non0repudiation ensures proof
                                exists that they sent it.</li>
                            <li>In online banking, a customer cannot deny making a money transfer because the system
                                records their digital signature.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Protection Methods:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Digital Signatures â€“ Ensures messages are tied to a specific sender.</li>
                            <li>Transaction logs â€“ Maintain records of all activities.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Security Mechanisms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A security mechanism is a tool or process that helps protect data and systems from attacks.</li>
                    <li>Why are security mechanisms important?
                        <ul class="lstn">
                            <li>âœ” They enforce security policies</li>
                            <li>âœ” They detect and prevent attacks</li>
                            <li>âœ” They help in secure communication and data protection</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Think of it like this: If security services are the laws, then security mechanisms are the
                        police and tools that enforce those laws. ðŸš“ðŸ”’</li>
                    <li>Security mechanisms are divided into two types:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Specific Security Mechanisms (Designed for particular security functions)</li>
                            <li>Pervasive Security Mechanisms (Work in the background to support overall security)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>1. Specific Security Mechanisms</strong></p>
                <p>These mechanisms are directly used to provide security. They are designed for specific security
                    functions like encryption, authentication, and access control.
                    <br>Here are some key specific security mechanisms:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Encipherment (Encryption): This mechanism converts readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable
                        format (ciphertext) to prevent unauthorized access.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>WhatsApp messages are encrypted, meaning only the sender and receiver can read
                                        them.</li>
                                    <li>Websites using HTTPS protect your credit card details during online shopping.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                        decryption (RSA, ECC).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Digital Signatures: A digital signature ensures that a message or document is authentic and
                        hasnâ€™t been modified.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example:

                <h3>Understand the Need for Authentication</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Imagine you're logging into your bank account. How does the system know it's really you? That's
                        where authentication comes in!</li>
                    <li>Authentication ensures that only the right person (or device) is allowed access to a system,
                        preventing unauthorized users from getting in.</li>
                    <li>In networks, authentication helps verify the identity of users, devices, and systems before
                        granting access to sensitive data or services.</li>
                    <li>Without authentication, anyone could pretend to be you, leading to data breaches, identity
                        theft, and system misuse.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What are the common threats related to authentication?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> Hackers trick users into revealing their passwords by
                        pretending to be a legitimate website.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brute Force Attacks:</strong> Automated programs try multiple password combinations
                        until they find the right one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:</strong> A hacker secretly intercepts and alters
                        communication between two parties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credential Stuffing:</strong> Attackers use stolen usernames and passwords from one site
                        to try and log in to another.</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Hijacking:</strong> An attacker steals a user's active session, gaining
                        unauthorized access to their account.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How authentication ensures security in communication?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Username & Password:</strong> The most basic method, but weak if passwords are not
                        strong or are reused.</li>
                    <li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Adds an extra layer of security, requiring a
                        second verification step like a code sent to a phone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> Uses fingerprints, facial recognition, or retina
                        scans for secure and unique user identification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Certificates (SSL/TLS):</strong> Ensures encrypted and secure communication over
                        networks like the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kerberos Authentication:</strong> A network authentication protocol that uses encrypted
                        tickets to verify user identity without sending passwords.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <h3>Authentication Mechanisms</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Authentication mechanisms are the different methods used to verify the identity of users, devices,
                    or systems before granting access.</li>
                <li>Since passwords alone are not always secure, advanced mechanisms use cryptography, certificates, or
                    secure ticket-based systems to enhance security.</li>
                <li>Two well-known authentication mechanisms are <strong>Kerberos</strong> and <strong>X.509</strong>,
                    each designed for different
                    scenarios:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Kerberos:</strong> Used in network environments where users need to authenticate
                            securely without repeatedly entering passwords.</li>
                        <li><strong>X.509:</strong> Used in internet security, such as SSL/TLS certificates, to verify
                            identities online.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Kerberos</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kerberos is a network authentication protocol, which means it helps verify whether a user is
                        real and trusted before allowing access to a network. Imagine you want to enter a high-security
                        building. You canâ€™t just walk in; you need an ID card or pass that proves you are authorized.
                        Kerberos works the same way but for computer networks.</li>
                    <li>The main goal of Kerberos is security. It ensures that only verified users can access network
                        resources and prevents attackers from pretending to be someone else.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why Do We Need Kerberos?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Letâ€™s say youâ€™re logging into your college Wi-Fi or a company server. The system needs to
                        confirm that:
                        <ol>
                            <li>You are who you say you are (authentication).</li>
                            <li>You are authorized to access specific resources (authorization).</li>
                            <li>Your login details are not stolen while being sent over the network.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Without proper authentication, hackers can steal passwords and pretend to be real users.
                        Kerberos solves this by using tickets instead of passwords for authentication.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Key Features of Kerberos</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Client-Server Architecture
                        <ul>
                            <li>The user (client) requests access to network services.</li>
                            <li>The server provides access only after authentication.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Uses Symmetric Key Encryption
                        <ul>
                            <li>The same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making communication secure.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Relies on a Trusted Third Party (TTP)
                        <ul>
                            <li>This trusted authority is called the Key Distribution Center (KDC).</li>
                            <li>KDC manages authentication and provides secret keys securely.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Understanding Kerberos with an Example</h3>
                <img src="../../images/cl1.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>Letâ€™s say you want to access a companyâ€™s internal database. Hereâ€™s how Kerberos ensures secure access
                    step by step:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You Request Access
                        <ul>
                            <li>You (the user) send a request to Kerberosâ€™ Key Distribution Center (KDC), saying,
                                "Hey, I need access to the database!"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Authentication Server (AS) Checks Your Identity
                        <ul>
                            <li>KDC has two parts:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Authentication Server (AS) â€“ Verifies who you are.</li>
                                    <li>Ticket Granting Server (TGS) â€“ Gives access to network services.</li>
                                </ol>
                                AS checks if you are registered in the system. If valid, AS sends you an encrypted
                                ticket.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You Decrypt the Ticket
                        <ul>
                            <li>This ticket is like a sealed letter that only you can open. You decrypt it using your
                                secret key (like a password). The decrypted ticket contains a hash code (a special
                                encrypted signature).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Proving Your Identity
                        <ul>
                            <li>You send the hash code back to AS as proof that you successfully decrypted the ticket.
                                If the hash code is correct, AS confirms, "Yes, this person is real!"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Getting a Service Ticket
                        <ul>
                            <li>AS now involves Ticket Granting Server (TGS). TGS generates a Service Ticket (also
                                called a session key). This ticket is like a VIP pass that allows you to access network
                                services.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Accessing the Network
                        <ul>
                            <li>With the service ticket, you can now communicate securely with the database or any other
                                network service. The service ticket ensures that you donâ€™t have to send your password
                                again. Instead, you use the ticket to prove your authenticity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Why is Kerberos Secure?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>No Passwords Sent Over the Network
                        <ul>
                            <li>Instead of sending your password, Kerberos uses encrypted tickets.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Session Keys for Each Login
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every session has a unique secret key, making it hard for attackers to reuse old data.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Mutual Authentication
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not only does the server verify the user, but the user also verifies the server,
                                preventing phishing attacks.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Prevents Replay Attacks
                        <ul>
                            <li>Even if an attacker captures your ticket, they cannot reuse it because Kerberos
                                timestamps each ticket.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Kerberos is widely used in corporate networks, government systems, and even Windows Active Directory.
                    It ensures that only real, trusted users can access network resources while keeping everything
                    secure.</p>

                <h3>X-509 Authentication Service</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>X.509 is a <strong>digital certificate standard</strong> used for public key authentication in
                        network security.</li>
                    <li>It helps verify identities over the internet by issuing digital certificates that prove someone
                        is who they claim to be.</li>
                    <li>Imagine you visit a website, and your browser shows a <strong>padlock icon (ðŸ”’)</strong>. This
                        means the website has a valid X.509 certificate, proving itâ€™s legitimate and not a fake site
                        trying to steal your data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Do We Need X.509?</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Without proper authentication, attackers can <strong>impersonate websites, servers, or even
                            people</strong>.</li>
                    <li>X.509 helps prevent such attacks by:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Providing a <strong>trusted way</strong> to verify identities using digital
                                certificates.</li>
                            <li>Encrypting communications using <strong>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Preventing <strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks</strong>, where attackers try to

                </ul>

                <h3>How Does X.509 Work?</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>X.509 uses <strong>public key cryptography</strong>, where each user has:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A <strong>public key</strong> (shared with others).</li>
                            <li>A <strong>private key</strong> (kept secret).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>A <strong>Certificate Authority (CA)</strong> issues digital certificates that bind a public key
                        to a specific user or organization.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Understanding X.509 with an Example</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Letâ€™s say you visit <strong>https://www.example.com</strong>. Your browser checks the websiteâ€™s
                        X.509 certificate:</li>
                    <li><strong>It verifies the Issuer (CA):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Checks if the <strong>Certificate Authority</strong> (e.g., <strong>DigiCert, Letâ€™s
                                    Encrypt</strong>) is trustworthy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>It checks the Validity Period:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the certificate is expired, your browser warns you.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>It ensures the Public Key matches the website:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prevents attackers from using <strong>fake certificates</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If everything checks out, your browser <strong>trusts</strong> the website, and you can browse
                        securely.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why is X.509 Secure?</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Prevents Identity Fraud</strong> â€“ Ensures only verified entities get certificates.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Uses Strong Cryptography</strong> â€“ Public-private key encryption makes data secure.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Supports Certificate Revocation</strong> â€“ If a certificate is compromised, it can be
                        revoked.</li>

        Overview of Unit 1: Introduction to Network Security

This unit is all about understanding network security, why it's important, and how we protect data from attacks. Hereâ€™s how everything fits together and how you can approach studying it:
Step 1: Understanding the Basics of Network Security

Before jumping into attacks and mechanisms, you first need to know what network security is and why it matters. Think of it like securing your houseâ€”you need locks, cameras, and alarms to prevent intruders. Similarly, in networking, security ensures that data stays safe, private, and unchanged.

ðŸ‘‰ Goals of Network Security: Here, youâ€™ll learn about the three main objectives:

    Confidentiality (keeping data private)
    Integrity (ensuring data isnâ€™t altered)
    Availability (making sure data is accessible when needed)

Step 2: The ISO Security Architecture & Network Attacks

Now that you know why security is needed, letâ€™s look at what weâ€™re protecting against. The ISO Security Architecture provides a structured way to understand security concepts.

ðŸ“Œ Attacks & Their Categories:

    Active Attacks (altering, modifying data)
    Passive Attacks (eavesdropping, stealing information)
    Insider & Outsider Attacks (who is attacking)

Understanding these attacks helps you see what threats exist in a network.
Step 3: Security Services & Mechanisms

Once you know about attacks, the next step is how to defend against them. Here, youâ€™ll explore Network Security Services & Mechanismsâ€”think of these as tools to secure a network. These include:

    Encryption (hiding data)
    Firewalls (blocking unauthorized access)
    Authentication (verifying identities)

Step 4: Authentication Applications (Kerberos & X.509)

Now that weâ€™ve covered security in general, letâ€™s focus on authentication, which ensures that only the right people get access.

ðŸ”‘ Kerberos
This is like a digital ticket systemâ€”when you log in, you get a ticket that allows you to access services without entering your password repeatedly. It prevents password theft by ensuring your credentials arenâ€™t sent over the network.

ðŸ“œ X.509 Directory Authentication Service
This is a certificate-based authentication system. Itâ€™s like having a digital ID card that proves your identity. It is widely used in websites (SSL certificates) and secure email systems.
