            <li>When we think of cybersecurity, protecting systems and data goes beyond just passwords — it’s about
                securing both the communication channels and the systems themselves. In this unit, we focus on two key
                areas: IP Security and System Security.</li>
            <li>We’ll start with IP Security (IPSec), which is all about protecting data as it travels over networks.
                You’ll learn about two core components — the Authentication Header (AH), which ensures the data hasn't
                been tampered with, and the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), which keeps the contents confidential
                and secure.</li>
            <li>After that, we move on to the broader topic of System Security, where we look at threats like intruders
                and viruses, and how we can detect or block them using tools like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and
                firewalls. We also explore what makes a system "trusted", how the operating system plays a major role in
                security, and how vulnerabilities in programs themselves can be exploited if not properly secured.</li>
