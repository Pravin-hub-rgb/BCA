        <ul>
            <li>When we think of cybersecurity, protecting systems and data goes beyond just passwords — it’s about
                securing both the communication channels and the systems themselves. In this unit, we focus on two key
                areas: IP Security and System Security.</li>
            <li>We’ll start with IP Security (IPSec), which is all about protecting data as it travels over networks.
                You’ll learn about two core components — the Authentication Header (AH), which ensures the data hasn't
                been tampered with, and the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), which keeps the contents confidential
                and secure.</li>
            <li>After that, we move on to the broader topic of System Security, where we look at threats like intruders
                and viruses, and how we can detect or block them using tools like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and
                firewalls. We also explore what makes a system "trusted", how the operating system plays a major role in
                security, and how vulnerabilities in programs themselves can be exploited if not properly secured.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Authentication Header (AH) – Verifying the Sender and Integrity</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Think of AH as a digital signature on your message. It doesn't hide the content, but it makes sure:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The data really came from the sender.</li>
                    <li>It wasn't changed during transmission.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>AH is like sealing the envelope with a signature wax stamp.
                    Anyone can read the letter (because it's not encrypted), but if the seal is broken or the stamp
                    doesn't match, you know something's wrong.</li>
                <li><strong>What AH Protects:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Source authenticity: Confirms who sent the data.</li>
                        <li>Integrity: Ensures the data wasn't modified.</li>
                        <li>Anti-replay: Blocks old or duplicated packets from being reused in attacks.</li>
                        <li>But remember—AH doesn't provide confidentiality. The data inside is still visible to anyone.
                            That's
                            where ESP comes in.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) – Keeping Data Confidential</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Now, imagine you want to send a secret message—one that nobody else should read. You'd use a locked
                    box. That's what ESP does.</li>
                <li>ESP encrypts the data, which means even if someone intercepts it, they'll only see gibberish. And
                    just like AH, ESP can also verify authenticity and integrity (if configured to do so).</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>What ESP Offers:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Confidentiality: Encrypts the data so it can't be read by others.</li>
                    <li>Integrity and authenticity: Optional features to ensure the data is genuine and unchanged.</li>
                    <li>Replay protection: Prevents attackers from resending captured packets.</li>
                    <li>So, ESP = encryption + optional integrity + anti-replay</li>
                    <li>Whereas AH = only integrity + authenticity + anti-replay</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>AH vs. ESP — Which One Do You Use?</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>It depends on the situation.</li>
                </ul>

                            <td>Some parts</td>
                            <td>More parts</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Used for privacy?</td>
                            <td>No</td>

                <ul>
                    <li>So, if you're sending something sensitive like a password or personal message, you'd use ESP.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you just need to make sure the data hasn't been tampered with, AH might be enough.</li>
                    <li>In most real-world scenarios today, ESP is more commonly used, because encryption is usually
                        essential.</li>

            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Where is IP Security (IPSec) Used?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>IPSec is widely used in:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>VPNs (Virtual Private Networks): To create secure "tunnels" between your device and a remote
                            server.</li>
                        <li>Secure communication between offices or servers.</li>
                        <li>Protecting data in sensitive systems, like banking, defense, or healthcare.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Let's say you're working remotely and connecting to your company network using a VPN. That
                        secure
                        connection? Most likely built using IPSec!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Wrapping Up — Why Does IPSec Matter?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Because it ensures:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your private emails, passwords, and sensitive info stay safe while traveling across the
                            internet.</li>
                        <li>Hackers can't snoop, tamper, or pretend to be someone else.</li>
                        <li>Big networks like corporate or government systems can trust their communication pipelines.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>So next time you hear about a secure connection or see the term "IPSec tunnel," you'll know it's
                        not magic—just some clever use of AH and ESP working behind the scenes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>What is System Security?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Imagine your computer or network is a kingdom. System Security is the entire army, walls, moats, and
                    laws that protect it from invaders (hackers), disasters (viruses), and internal spies (insiders).
                    It’s not just one tool—it’s a combination of strategies, tools, and practices to keep everything
                    safe.
                </li>
                <li> System Security refers to the collection of security mechanisms, policies, and procedures used to
                    protect computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification,
                    destruction, or improper disclosure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Protects your data (photos, bank details, secrets).</li>
                <li>Keeps services running (no ransomware shutting down hospitals!).</li>
                <li>Builds trust (would you shop on a website that gets hacked every week?).</li>
                <li>Real-Life Example: When the Colonial Pipeline got hacked in 2021, it disrupted fuel supply across
                    the U.S. for days. System Security failures can have real-world chaos!</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Breaking Down System Security</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Under the "System Security" umbrella, we tackle threats from all angles. Let’s explore each
                        sub-topic in order, like layers of defense:</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>1. Intruders: Who’s Trying to Break In?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Think of intruders as uninvited guests at a party. They want to crash your system, steal data,
                        or cause chaos.</li>
                    <li> An intruder is any unauthorized entity (user, script, or program) attempting to gain access to
                        system resources or data without proper authorization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Types of Intruders:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Script Kiddies: Amateurs using pre-made tools (like a thief with a crowbar from
                                YouTube).</li>
                            <li>Hacktivists: Motivated by politics or ideology (e.g., hacking a government site to
                                protest).</li>
                            <li>Insiders: Employees leaking data—like a cashier sneaking money from the register.</li>
                            <li>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): Sophisticated, long-term attackers (think “spy
                                movie” hackers).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>How They Get In:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Phishing emails (“Click this fake UPS link!”).</li>
                            <li>Exploiting weak passwords (“password123”).</li>
                            <li>Unpatched software vulnerabilities (like leaving a window unlocked).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Real-Life Example: The 2013 Target breach started with hackers stealing an HVAC vendor’s
                        credentials!</li>
                    <li><strong>Why Care? →</strong> Intruders are the reason we need tools like IDS to catch them
                        before they cause harm.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): The Digital Watchdog</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>An IDS isn’t just a guard—it’s a guard with a magnifying glass, analyzing everything.</li>
                    <li> An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is a device or software application that monitors network
                        or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations.</li>
                    <li><strong>How It Works:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Signature-Based Detection:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Matches patterns to a database of known attacks (like recognizing a wanted
                                        criminal’s face).</li>
                                    <li>Example: Blocking traffic that matches a known ransomware signature.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Anomaly-Based Detection:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Learns “normal” behavior and flags deviations (e.g., your quiet office printer
                                        suddenly sending gigabytes of data).</li>
                                    <li>Example: Your smart fridge trying to connect to a Russian server at 2 AM.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Hybrid Systems:</strong> Combine both for better accuracy (like a detective
                                using fingerprints and witness accounts).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>False alarms (your cat stepping on the keyboard might look like a hacker!).</li>
                            <li>Can’t stop attacks—only alert you. That’s why we pair it with… firewalls!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Viruses & Malware: The Sneaky Saboteurs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Viruses are just one type of malware. Let’s meet the whole “malicious family”:</li>
                    <li> Malware (malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a
                        computer, server, client, or network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Types of Malware:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Viruses: Attach to files (e.g., a corrupted Word doc).</li>
                            <li>Worms: Spread without user action.</li>
                            <li>Trojans: Disguised as harmless software.</li>
                            <li>Ransomware: Locks your files until you pay.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>How They Spread:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Email attachments, infected ads (malvertising), USB drives, pirated software.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Real-Life Example: The ILOVEYOU virus (2000) caused $15 billion in damage by tricking users to
                        open a “love letter” email.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fighting Back:</strong> Use antivirus software, but also build a strong gatekeeper—your
                        firewall.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Firewalls: The Ultimate Gatekeeper</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A firewall isn’t just a wall—it’s a smart filter deciding what traffic enters/leaves your
                        network.</li>
                    <li> A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network
                        traffic based on predetermined security rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Types of Firewalls:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Packet-Filtering: Checks basic headers (IP address, port).</li>
                            <li>Stateful Inspection: Tracks active connections.</li>
                            <li>Next-Gen Firewalls (NGFW): Adds deep packet inspection.</li>
                            <li>Proxy Firewalls: Acts as a middleman, hiding your network.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Home Example: Your Wi-Fi router’s firewall blocks strangers from accessing your smart TV.</li>
                    <li>Corporate Example: A company firewall blocks employees from accessing risky sites like illegal
                        torrents.</li>
                    <li><strong>But Even Firewalls Can’t Stop Everything →</strong> For critical systems, we need
                        Trusted Systems.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>5. Trusted Systems: The Digital Fort Knox</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>These are systems built with security as the #1 priority, often used for top-secret data.</li>
                    <li> A trusted system is a system that employs security measures to enforce a set of policies and is
                        trusted to handle sensitive or critical operations without compromising integrity,
                        confidentiality, or availability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Features:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Users can’t override permissions.</li>
                            <li>Audit Logs: Records every action.</li>
                            <li>Formal Verification: Mathematically proven to be secure.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Real-World Uses:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Military databases, nuclear power plant controls, medical records.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Example: Apple’s T2 Security Chip encrypts data on MacBooks—a “trusted” hardware layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>But Trusted Systems Still Run on… →</strong> Operating Systems, which need their own
                        security!</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>6. OS Security: Protecting the Foundation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux) is like the foundation of a house. If it’s weak, everything
                        collapses.</li>
                    <li> Operating System Security involves implementing security measures at the OS level to ensure the
                        confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Protections:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>User Account Control (UAC): Asks for permission before installing software.</li>
                            <li>File Permissions: Stops guests from deleting system files.</li>
                            <li>Kernel Protection: Safeguards the core of the OS.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Common Threats:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Privilege escalation (a hacker gaining admin access).</li>
                            <li>Zero-day exploits (attacks on unpatched vulnerabilities).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Example: Windows Defender (built-in antivirus) vs. ransomware attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>But Even a Secure OS Can’t Fix… →</strong> Badly coded apps! Enter Program Security.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>7. Program Security: Coding Without “Oops” Moments</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Program security is about writing software that’s resistant to attacks.</li>
                    <li> Program Security involves designing, writing, and maintaining software in a way that prevents
                        vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Common Vulnerabilities:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Buffer Overflow: Hackers flood a program with data to hijack it.</li>
                            <li>SQL Injection: Sending malicious database queries through a login form (e.g.,
                                <pre><code>' OR 1=1 --</code></pre> to bypass passwords).
                            </li>
                            <li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious code into websites (e.g., stealing
                                cookies).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Coding Practices:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Input validation (sanitizing user data).</li>
                            <li>Using prepared statements for databases.</li>
                            <li>Regular code reviews and penetration testing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Real-Life Fail: The 2017 Equifax breach happened due to unpatched Apache Struts software.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How Everything Connects: The Security Puzzle</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Intruders try to sneak in → IDS spots them → Firewalls block suspicious traffic.</li>
                    <li>Viruses slip through → Antivirus quarantines them → OS Security limits damage.</li>
                    <li>Trusted Systems protect critical data → Program Security ensures apps don’t have backdoors.</li>
                    <li>It’s like a castle with walls, guards, traps, and a moat—each layer adds protection!</li>
