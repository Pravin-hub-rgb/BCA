        <li>When you're diving into the world of cybersecurity, it's not just about hacking or stopping viruses — there's also a strong legal backbone and technical foundation that holds everything together. In this unit, we begin with the basics of Cyber Law, where you'll understand what the terms cyber, cybercrime, and cybercriminals really mean, and how laws are used to regulate activities in the digital world.</li>
        <li>We then move into the IT Act 2000, exploring why it was created, its scope, and how it legally recognizes electronic records and digital signatures. You’ll also see how the government uses these digital tools in official processes, making governance more tech-enabled.</li>
        <li>Once the legal groundwork is laid, we’ll shift gears into the technical side — the basics of network security. Here, you’ll learn what IP addresses, port numbers, and sockets are, and how attackers try to hide or trace them. From there, we dig deeper into scanning techniques like traceroute, ping sweeping, and port scanning — which are often the first steps in discovering vulnerabilities. Finally, you’ll explore fingerprinting, which is all about identifying systems either actively or silently — sometimes just by analyzing emails.</li>
