            <li>When you're diving into the world of cybersecurity, it's not just about hacking or stopping viruses —
                there's also a strong legal backbone and technical foundation that holds everything together. In this
                unit, we begin with the basics of Cyber Law, where you'll understand what the terms cyber, cybercrime,
                and cybercriminals really mean, and how laws are used to regulate activities in the digital world.</li>
            <li>We then move into the IT Act 2000, exploring why it was created, its scope, and how it legally
                recognizes electronic records and digital signatures. You’ll also see how the government uses these
                digital tools in official processes, making governance more tech-enabled.</li>
            <li>Once the legal groundwork is laid, we’ll shift gears into the technical side — the basics of network
                security. Here, you’ll learn what IP addresses, port numbers, and sockets are, and how attackers try to
                hide or trace them. From there, we dig deeper into scanning techniques like traceroute, ping sweeping,
                and port scanning — which are often the first steps in discovering vulnerabilities. Finally, you’ll
                explore fingerprinting, which is all about identifying systems either actively or silently — sometimes
                just by analyzing emails.</li>

            <h2>Introduction to Cyber Law</h2>

            <p>
                As we move deeper into the digital age, our dependence on the internet has grown — from chatting with
                friends and making payments online to storing important files on cloud services. But just like we have
                laws to regulate actions in the physical world, we need rules for the virtual world too. That’s where
                <strong>Cyber Law</strong> comes in. Before we understand what it means, let’s take a step back and look
                at the world we are dealing with — the <strong>cyber world</strong>.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>What is "Cyber"?</strong>
                    <p>
                        The term "cyber" refers to anything related to computers, networks, and the internet. It's the
                        virtual space where all digital activities happen — from browsing websites and sending emails to
                        managing online bank accounts.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cyber space = digital environment where communication and transactions occur.</li>
                        <li>Cyber activities = every action that involves computers, data, and networks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Cyber Crime – When Things Go Wrong</strong>
                    <p>
                        Now, just like in the real world, not everyone uses cyberspace responsibly. Some people misuse
                        it to harm others, steal information, or cheat systems — these actions are called <strong>cyber
                            crimes</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cyber crime includes:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hacking into someone’s email or social media account.</li>
                                <li>Stealing credit card data or personal details.</li>
                                <li>Spreading viruses or ransomware.</li>
                                <li>Online scams, fake websites, and digital frauds.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The digital nature of these crimes makes them hard to detect, trace, and prove without
                            proper understanding of networks and systems.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    <strong>Who Are Cyber Criminals?</strong>
                    <p>
                        A cyber criminal isn’t always a masked hacker typing away in a dark room. It could be anyone —
                        from a tech-savvy teenager testing their skills, to organized crime groups or even insiders in a
                        company.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Types of cyber criminals:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Script Kiddies:</strong> Beginners who use ready-made tools to cause damage
                                    without full knowledge.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hacktivists:</strong> Hackers with a political or social motive.</li>
                                <li><strong>Insiders:</strong> Employees or ex-staff who misuse access to leak or damage
                                    company data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cyber Terrorists:</strong> Individuals or groups attacking networks to
                                    spread fear or disruption.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    <strong>Cyber Law – Why Do We Need It?</strong>
                    <p>
                        With all the potential threats and crimes in cyberspace, there must be a legal framework to
                        prevent misuse, protect users, and punish wrongdoers. This is what <strong>Cyber Law</strong>
                        (also known as Internet Law or IT Law) does.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cyber Law helps to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Protect personal and financial data.</li>
                                <li>Regulate electronic transactions and e-commerce.</li>
                                <li>Punish cyber crimes like hacking, fraud, or identity theft.</li>
                                <li>Set legal guidelines for digital communication and content.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In India, this is mainly governed under the <strong>Information Technology (IT) Act,
                                2000</strong>, which defines cyber crimes and their punishments.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                So in short, as our online presence grows, the need for awareness and understanding of <strong>cyber
                    law</strong> becomes more important than ever — not just for legal experts, but for students,
                businesses, and everyday internet users like us.

            <h2>Object and Scope of the IT Act</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine a time before 2000 — people relied heavily on paper for communication, contracts, and records.
                As internet usage started growing in India, more people began using emails, online payments, and digital
                documents. But there was a big legal problem: the law didn’t recognize anything electronic as "official"
                or "valid." This gap led to the creation of a new law — the <strong>Information Technology Act,
                    2000</strong>, often referred to as the <strong>IT Act</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Genesis of the Act</strong>
                    <p>
                        The IT Act was India’s answer to the legal challenges of the digital world. It was passed in the
                        year 2000 to support e-commerce, recognize digital transactions, and protect users online. The
                        need became urgent because global trade and business were moving online, and India needed a
                        legal structure to keep up with the rest of the world.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>India signed the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law
                            on e-commerce in 1996.</li>
                        <li>This pushed India to form its own cyber law, leading to the IT Act, 2000.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Object of the Act</strong>
                    <p>
                        The core purpose of the IT Act is to give legal recognition to digital records and digital
                        signatures, and to promote secure and efficient electronic communication. The Act ensures that
                        transactions made via computers or the internet are legally valid and enforceable in a court of
                        law.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To provide legal recognition to electronic records and digital signatures.</li>
                        <li>To regulate cyber crimes and punish offenders.</li>
                        <li>To promote electronic governance and reduce paperwork in government offices.</li>
                        <li>To encourage e-commerce and digital communication in business and personal life.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Scope of the Act</strong>
                    <p>
                        The IT Act doesn’t just deal with cyber crimes — its scope is quite wide. It applies to both
                        individuals and organizations who use computers or networks. Whether you're sending an email,
                        signing a digital contract, or storing files on the cloud, you are under the scope of this law.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Applies to the entire territory of India.</li>
                        <li>Also applies to offences committed outside India if the act affects systems or data within
                            India.</li>
                        <li>Applies to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Individuals</li>
                                <li>Companies</li>
                                <li>Government departments</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>E-Governance and the IT Act 2000</strong>
                    <p>
                        One of the major focuses of the IT Act is promoting <strong>e-governance</strong>. That means
                        making government services accessible online — like applying for passports, paying taxes, or
                        checking exam results — to save time, reduce corruption, and improve transparency.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Act allows government departments to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Accept and send electronic records.</li>
                                <li>Digitally sign official documents.</li>
                                <li>Maintain and preserve records in electronic form.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Legal Recognition of Electronic Records</strong>
                    <p>
                        Before the IT Act, only paper-based records were considered official in court. Now, thanks to
                        the Act, electronic files like PDFs, emails, scanned documents, or anything stored digitally are
                        treated as valid records.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Section 4 of the IT Act states that any information in electronic form shall not be denied
                            legal validity.</li>
                        <li>This change supports e-commerce, online banking, and digital communication.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Legal Recognition of Digital Signatures</strong>
                    <p>
                        Just like we sign physical documents using ink, digital documents are "signed" electronically.
                        The IT Act gives legal recognition to <strong>digital signatures</strong>, making them valid
                        proofs of identity and consent.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Digital signatures use encryption to ensure:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Authenticity — confirming the identity of the sender.</li>
                                <li>Integrity — making sure the message isn’t altered.</li>
                                <li>Non-repudiation — the sender cannot deny the transaction later.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <strong>Use of Electronic Records and Digital Signatures in Government</strong>
                    <p>
                        With the IT Act in place, governments can now go paperless for many services. From issuing birth
                        certificates to filing taxes, departments can use electronic records and digital signatures to
                        handle official work securely and efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Examples of use:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Income tax return filings.</li>
                                <li>Online issue of driving licenses or PAN cards.</li>
                                <li>E-courts and digital submission of evidence.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So overall, the IT Act acts as the backbone of India’s digital legal system. It ensures that as we move
                toward a paperless and tech-driven future, our rights, data, and identity are protected under the law —
                just like they would be in the real world.

            <h2>IT Act in Detail</h2>

            <p>
                Once we understand the purpose and scope of the IT Act, the next logical step is to explore how it’s
                structured in detail. The IT Act, 2000 is not just a law that recognizes digital records — it’s a
                complete legal framework that defines what is legal and illegal in cyberspace, who enforces the law, how
                justice is delivered, and what consequences exist for violating it.

                    <strong>Structure of the IT Act</strong>
                    <p>
                        The Act is divided into multiple <strong>Chapters</strong> and <strong>Sections</strong>, each
                        covering a specific area of digital law. It covers both civil and criminal offenses and provides
                        legal procedures for investigation and trial.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Total Sections:</strong> Originally 94 sections (divided across 13 chapters), but it
                            has been amended several times.</li>
                        <li><strong>Important Chapters include:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Chapter II: Legal recognition of electronic records.</li>

                    <p>
                        No law can function without people or institutions enforcing it. The IT Act defines various
                        roles to ensure the smooth implementation of cyber laws and resolution of disputes.

                        The IT Act handles both <strong>civil offenses</strong> (handled by adjudicating officers) and
                        <strong>criminal offenses</strong> (handled by courts under CrPC). These offenses cover
                        everything from simple data misuse to serious hacking crimes.

                    <strong>Amendments and IT (Amendment) Act, 2008</strong>
                    <p>
                        In 2008, the Act was amended to include emerging challenges like cyber terrorism, privacy
                        protection, and stronger punishments. It also introduced the term “sensitive personal data,”
                        which is now essential for data privacy laws.

                    <ul>
                        <li>New sections added like:

                                <li><strong>Section 66F:</strong> Cyber terrorism (acts that threaten the unity or
                                    security of the country).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Strengthened protection of user data and digital privacy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Procedures and Investigation</strong>
                    <p>
                        The IT Act works hand-in-hand with other laws like the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Code of
                        Criminal Procedure (CrPC). For serious cyber crimes, police departments have <strong>Cyber Crime
                            Cells</strong> with technical expertise.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Police can register FIRs under relevant IT Act sections.</li>
                        <li>For cross-border crimes, cooperation with international cyber law agencies is needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                So, while the IT Act started as a way to legally accept digital records, over the years it has grown
                into a strong legal system that protects individuals, businesses, and government from digital misuse.
                Whether it’s securing your online identity or punishing those who exploit the internet — this Act is the
                foundation of India’s cyber law enforcement.

            <h2>Basics of Network Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Imagine you're sitting in your college computer lab, trying to upload a file to <strong>Google
                        Drive</strong>. Have you ever wondered — how does that file actually travel from your computer
                    all
                    the way to Google’s server, which is not even in your college or your city? Let's break down this
                    entire
                    journey using the different types of addresses involved — <strong>MAC address</strong>, <strong>IP
                        address</strong>, <strong>port number</strong>, and <strong>socket</strong>. We’ll also relate
                    it to
                    the actual devices you see around in your lab.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inside your lab, all the computers are connected to a <strong>switch</strong>. Usually, it's a
                    24-port
                    switch that physically connects computers using LAN cables. Now, to allow communication between
                    these
                    computers, each device needs a unique identifier — and that’s the <strong>MAC address</strong>.
                    Think of
                    it like your device’s permanent ID tag given by the manufacturer. It looks something like
                    <code>3C:52:82:0A:65:AC</code> and is used only within the local network. The switch maintains a
                    table
                    of these MAC addresses to decide which computer is on which port, so it can send data directly to
                    the
                    correct system without flooding the entire network.
                </li>
                <li>
                    But here’s the catch — the MAC address works only within the local area network (LAN). It’s useless
                    when
                    you’re trying to access a server outside your lab — like Google Drive. For external communication,
                    we
                    need something else: a <strong>logical address</strong>, which is your <strong>IP address</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As soon as you try to upload a file, your system prepares to send a request to
                    <code>drive.google.com</code>. But your computer doesn’t know the actual IP address of Google’s
                    server,
                    so it first contacts a <strong>DNS server</strong> — like looking up a phonebook — to get the real
                    IP
                    address of the website. For example, Google Drive might resolve to something like
                    <code>142.250.67.14</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once your system knows the IP, it can now send the request across the internet. This IP address is
                    typically provided by your local router, which might get it from your ISP. The IP address works at
                    the
                    <strong>Network Layer</strong> and ensures your request knows where to go, even if it has to jump
                    across
                    cities or countries. Earlier, we used <strong>IPv4</strong> which is 32-bit (like
                    <code>192.168.1.10</code>), but now we are shifting to <strong>IPv6</strong>, which is 128-bit,
                    because
                    the number of devices worldwide has grown rapidly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now here’s another twist — when your request reaches Google’s server, how does it know you want to
                    access Google Drive and not YouTube, Gmail, or some other service? That’s where the <strong>port
                        number</strong> comes in. Each service on a server listens on a different port:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Web traffic (HTTPS) → Port <code>443</code></li>
                        <li>Non-secure HTTP → Port <code>80</code></li>
                        <li>File transfer (FTP) → Port <code>21</code></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    So your browser, while sending the request, also includes the port number (usually 443 for HTTPS) to
                    specify which service it wants. Your own system also picks a random port temporarily (like
                    <code>51004</code>) to identify this session.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you combine the IP address and the port number, it becomes a <strong>socket</strong>. For
                    example,
                    <code>142.250.67.14:443</code> is a socket — it represents a connection to Google Drive’s secure
                    service. Likewise, your computer’s side might be represented as something like
                    <code>192.168.1.5:51004</code>. Both sides now have sockets, and a session is established between
                    them
                    for file transfer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Here’s a quick overview of what just happened when you uploaded that file to Google Drive:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your system prepares the file and sends the request.</li>

                                <li>The switch uses your MAC address to forward packets locally.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Outside the lab:

                                <li>Your router assigns an IP address to talk to the internet.</li>
                                <li>DNS resolves <code>drive.google.com</code> to its IP.</li>
                                <li>Your browser uses port <code>443</code> to talk to Google Drive.</li>
                                <li>A socket is formed using IP + Port.</li>

                    Linux),
                    you can see your device’s MAC address and current IP address. This confirms how your system is
                    uniquely
                    identified both locally (by MAC) and globally (by IP).

                <li>
                    So the journey of your file — from your lab PC to Google Drive — involves local device identifiers
                    (MAC), global routing (IP), service targeting (Port), and complete connection endpoints (Socket).
                    Every

                <h3>Hiding and Tracing IP Addresses</h3>

                <p>
                    Till now, we’ve understood how communication happens between devices over the internet using
                    concepts like <strong>IP addresses</strong>, <strong>port numbers</strong>, and
                    <strong>sockets</strong>. We saw how every device is assigned a unique logical address (IP) that
                    helps identify it on the network. But that also means — anyone communicating with your device knows
                    your IP. Now, in the world of networking and security, this leads us to two important needs:
                    <strong>hiding your IP</strong> and <strong>tracing someone else's IP</strong>. Let's explore why
                    and how both are done.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let’s say you’re browsing a website, or uploading something to Google Drive — your public IP address
                    is visible to the other side. In general cases, this is harmless. But in situations where you want
                    to protect your identity or location (for privacy or security reasons), <strong>IP hiding</strong>
                    becomes useful.

                                    <li>To access region-blocked services (e.g., streaming content not available in your
                                        country).</li>
                                    <li>To prevent tracking or targeting by websites or hackers.</li>
                                </ul>

                    On the other side of the story is <strong>IP tracing</strong>. Sometimes for security, legal, or
                    investigative purposes, there’s a need to find out the source of a connection — who sent a
                    suspicious packet? Where did an attack come from?

                                    <li>
                                        <strong>IP Header Inspection:</strong> Every packet carries source and
                                        destination IPs in its header. Firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS)
                                        can read this to detect sources.

                                        <strong>Log Analysis:</strong> Servers, routers, and firewalls maintain logs
                                        which record source IPs for each connection or attempt.
                                    </li>

                    So overall, <strong>hiding IP</strong> is about staying anonymous and secure, while <strong>tracing

                        security</strong>. The goal isn't just to understand addresses like IP and ports, but also to
                    know how they play a role in both protecting and investigating our digital communication.

            <h2>Scanning Techniques</h2>

            <p>
                In the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking, just knowing that a device exists on a network isn’t
                enough — we need to know how it behaves, what services it runs, and where its weaknesses lie. That’s
                where scanning techniques come in. These methods are used to gather critical information about systems
                and networks, often as part of the reconnaissance phase in ethical hacking or security testing.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Scanning is Needed</h3>

            <p>
                Imagine you’re securing a campus network. You know devices are connected, but you don’t know which ones
                are active, what ports are open, or what operating systems are running. Scanning gives you a map — it
                helps you identify what’s alive, what’s listening, and where you might be vulnerable. Attackers use
                these same techniques to plan their next moves, which is why defenders need to know them too.
            </p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Traceroute</h3>

                <p>
                    Traceroute is like a GPS tracker for packets. When you send data across the internet, it doesn't
                    travel in one straight line — it hops across multiple routers. Traceroute helps you visualize this
                    path.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>It shows the route a packet takes from source to destination.</li>
                    <li>It measures the time each hop (router) takes to respond.</li>
                    <li>Useful for:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diagnosing network delays</li>
                            <li>Finding where the connection is breaking or slowing down</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    From a security perspective, it helps identify what routers or firewalls your data passes through —
                    which can be valuable for understanding the network layout.

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Ping Sweeping</h3>

                <p>
                    Before scanning specific ports, you need to know which devices are actually online. Ping Sweeping is
                    a technique used to discover live hosts on a network.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sends ICMP Echo Requests (like a ping) to multiple IP addresses.</li>
                    <li>Devices that respond are considered "alive."</li>
                    <li>It's faster than checking each device manually.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    However, many firewalls block ICMP, so some systems may seem offline even if they’re up. That's why
                    it's just a starting step.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Port Scanning</h3>

                <p>
                    Once you know a device is online, the next question is: what services is it offering? That’s what
                    port scanning reveals. Every internet-connected service (like HTTP, FTP, or SSH) listens on a
                    specific port.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Port scanners (like Nmap) send requests to a range of ports to see which ones respond.</li>
                    <li>Helps identify:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Open ports (services actively listening)</li>
                            <li>Closed ports (not in use)</li>
                            <li>Filtered ports (blocked by a firewall)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Can even guess the service or version running on that port.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This is one of the most critical scanning techniques for both attackers and defenders — open ports
                    are often doors into the system.

                    ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) isn’t just for pinging. ICMP scanning uses different types
                    of ICMP messages to gather information about hosts.

                    <li>Used to detect:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Whether a host is up</li>
                            <li>Whether it blocks specific types of traffic</li>
                            <li>Network behavior under different conditions</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Some ICMP types used:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Type 8 – Echo Request</li>
                            <li>Type 0 – Echo Reply</li>
                            <li>Type 3 – Destination Unreachable</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    ICMP scanning is quiet compared to port scanning, but many modern firewalls filter out ICMP
                    messages, making it less reliable alone.

            <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>

            <p>
                These scanning techniques — traceroute, ping sweep, port scan, and ICMP scan — work together like a
                layered investigation. First, find the hosts (ping/ICMP), then map their route (traceroute), and finally
                inspect their doors (ports). For ethical hackers, this builds the foundation of vulnerability
                assessment. For system administrators, knowing this helps lock down potential entry points.
