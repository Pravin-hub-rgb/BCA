        <ul>
            <li>When we talk about cybersecurity, one of the most important things to understand is how systems are
                attacked — these methods are known as attack vectors. In simple terms, an attack vector is the path or
                technique used by a hacker to break into a system or cause harm. In this unit, we’ll explore different
                categories of attack vectors that every IT or security student should know.</li>
            <li>We’ll start with Buffer Overflow Attacks, which are more technical and involve manipulating memory to
                crash a system or take control of it — things like stack overflows, string overflows, and even heap or
                integer overflows fall under this.</li>
            <li>Then we’ll move into Internal Attacks, which are all about threats that come from within the
                organization or through common user channels — like suspicious emails, mobile apps, instant messengers,
                and even physical methods like dumpster diving or shoulder surfing.</li>
            <li>Finally, we’ll cover Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks, which are designed to overwhelm or crash systems
                so that real users can't access them. This includes notorious attacks like Ping of Death, SYN flooding,
                and even modern Distributed DoS (DDoS) methods that use multiple devices to attack at once.</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="t1" class="wh">
            <h2>Buffer Overflow Attacks</h2>
            <p>
                Buffer overflow attacks are a classic and dangerous class of vulnerabilities that exploit the way memory
                is handled in low-level languages like C and C++. These attacks occur when a program writes more data to
                a buffer (like an array or string) than it was designed to hold, causing unexpected behavior. But why is
                this dangerous? Because memory in programs is structured in predictable ways, overflowing one area can
                let an attacker take control over critical parts of a program — even injecting and executing malicious
                code.
            </p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Stack Overflows</h3>
                <p>
                    The stack is a special region of memory where local variables and function calls are stored. It
                    follows
                    a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order. A stack overflow happens when we push more data onto the stack
                    than
                    it can hold. This is the most commonly exploited type of buffer overflow.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attackers often target the return address stored on the stack.</li>
                    <li>By overflowing a local buffer (like a character array), they overwrite the return address with
                        the
                        location of their own malicious code.</li>
                    <li>When the function tries to return, it jumps to the attacker's code instead of the intended
                        return
                        point.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This kind of exploit can give attackers full control of the system if successful. It's one of the
                    reasons functions like <code>gets()</code> or <code>strcpy()</code> are considered dangerous — they
                    don’t check input size.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>String Overflows</h3>
                <p>
                    String overflows are a special case of buffer overflows where unbounded string input causes the
                    overflow. They often happen when dealing with C-style strings (null-terminated character arrays).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a function doesn't limit how many characters it copies or reads into a buffer, it can write
                        past
                        the end of that buffer.</li>
                    <li>This may overwrite adjacent memory, causing crashes, corrupted data, or exploitable conditions —
                        just like stack overflows.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Many famous attacks — like the Morris Worm — used string overflows to spread and execute code
                    remotely.
                    It's why functions like <code>strncpy()</code> and input validation are important.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Heap Overflows</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike the stack, which handles temporary and scoped data, the heap is used for dynamically
                    allocated
                    memory (via <code>malloc()</code> or <code>new</code>). A heap overflow happens when data written to
                    the
                    heap overruns the boundary of its allocated space.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heap overflows don't target the return address but can corrupt heap metadata or function
                        pointers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Attackers may exploit this to execute arbitrary code or manipulate program behavior.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These attacks are harder to perform than stack overflows, but they're equally dangerous and harder
                    to
                    detect. Secure memory management and modern heap protection techniques (like heap canaries) help
                    reduce
                    this risk.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Integer Overflows</h3>
                <p>
                    Integer overflows happen when a calculation results in a number too large (or too small) to be
                    stored in
                    the intended data type. While this isn’t a buffer overflow by itself, it can lead to one.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Imagine allocating a buffer using the result of an integer multiplication, but the value
                        overflows
                        and becomes very small.</li>
                    <li>The program then allocates a small buffer but proceeds to copy a large amount of data into it —
                        causing a buffer overflow.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Integer overflows are often overlooked but serve as a stepping stone for more severe attacks,
                    especially
                    in systems where input sizes are calculated without proper checks.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Understanding all these types of overflows is critical for both attackers and defenders. Developers must
                validate input sizes, use safe libraries, and leverage memory protection features in modern systems to
                prevent such vulnerabilities.
            </p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>How to Protect Against Buffer Overflow Attacks</h3>
                <p>Developers use several tricks and tools to stop buffer overflow attacks from messing with their
                    programs. Here are some common ways they stay safe:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Write Code Carefully : </strong>
                        Always check the size of the input, set boundaries, and use safer functions when dealing with
                        strings. Basically, don’t trust user input blindly!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use Memory Safety Features : </strong>
                        Features like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) help make memory locations
                        unpredictable. Also, marking parts of memory (like the stack or heap) as non-executable stops
                        attackers from running malicious code there.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use Code Checking Tools : </strong>
                        There are tools that scan your code (both while writing and during testing) to catch any buffer
                        overflow issues before they become a problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Run Code in a Safe Zone (Sandboxing) : </strong>
                        If a program does get attacked, running it in a restricted space means it can’t do much harm.
                        Also, separating user permissions keeps sensitive stuff safe.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Watch for Weird Behavior at Runtime : </strong>
                        Some tools keep an eye on how a program behaves while it’s running. If anything looks suspicious
                        (like memory being accessed in a strange way), it can stop the program right away.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Real-World Examples and Case Studies</h3>
                <p>
                    These vulnerabilities aren't just theoretical. Over the years, real-world incidents have shown how
                    deadly buffer overflow attacks can be. Here's a look at some major examples across each category:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stack Overflow – The Morris Worm (1988):</strong> One of the first and most famous worms
                        spread across the internet using a stack buffer overflow in the <code>finger</code> service on
                        Unix systems. It exploited poor input handling to execute remote code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>String Overflow – Microsoft IIS Unicode Bug (2001):</strong> This vulnerability allowed
                        attackers to send a long string in a web request, exploiting unvalidated Unicode input and
                        crashing or compromising the server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Heap Overflow – Microsoft Windows GDI+ (2004):</strong> A heap-based overflow in image
                        parsing routines (used when opening JPG files) could be triggered just by getting a user to open
                        a crafted image, leading to remote code execution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Integer Overflow – Apple's "goto fail" Bug & Adobe Flash:</strong> Multiple integer
                        overflow bugs have been found in Apple and Adobe products. In Adobe Flash, such overflows
                        allowed memory mismanagement and code injection through malformed video files.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These examples show that buffer overflow attacks affect every type of system — from web servers and
                    desktop applications to operating systems. Developers must stay vigilant, and secure coding
                    practices must always include bounds checking, safe memory handling, and modern protection
                    mechanisms like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), DEP (Data Execution Prevention), and
                    stack canaries.

            <h2>Internal Attacks</h2>
            <p>
                When we think about cyberattacks, it's easy to imagine hackers breaking in from the outside. But many
                serious security breaches come from within — through people or systems already inside the organization.
                These are called internal attacks. They’re dangerous because the attacker often has legitimate access
                and is trusted. Let’s explore how everyday tools and behaviors — like emails, mobile devices, and even
                trash bins — can become sources of internal threats.
            </p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Emails</h3>
                <p>
                    Emails are one of the most commonly used communication tools in organizations — and one of the most
                    exploited. An insider with malicious intent can misuse email in various ways, from sending sensitive
                    data out of the company to spreading malware internally.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An employee might attach confidential files and forward them to a competitor or personal email.
                    </li>
                    <li>Even well-meaning employees can fall victim to phishing emails that appear internal but are
                        actually crafted by attackers to steal login credentials.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is why email monitoring, employee training, and data loss prevention (DLP) tools are critical
                    components of internal security.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Mobile Phones</h3>
                <p>
                    Almost everyone carries a smartphone into the workplace. While convenient, mobile phones can also be
                    a source of data leakage or unauthorized recording.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Insiders can use their phones to take pictures of confidential documents or screens.</li>
                    <li>They might connect their phones to company computers and transfer sensitive data using USB
                        tethering or Bluetooth.</li>
                    <li>Even apps on a personal phone can silently record audio or log keystrokes if permissions are
                        misused.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is why many companies enforce mobile device management (MDM) policies and restrict phone usage
                    in high-security zones.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Instant Messengers</h3>
                <p>
                    Tools like Slack, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams are great for quick communication, but they can also
                    become unmonitored channels for data leakage.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An insider can easily copy and paste confidential data into a private message or group chat.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some attackers use messenger tools to coordinate with others during an internal breach.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Even seemingly harmless jokes or links shared in a company chat could lead to social engineering or

                <h3>FTP Uploads</h3>
                <p>
                    FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used to move large files across systems. It’s fast, but it’s also
                    risky if not secured — especially when internal users have access.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A rogue employee might upload confidential documents to an external FTP server they control.
                    </li>
                    <li>If FTP accounts are not properly monitored or logged, such activity can go undetected for long
                        periods.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Using secure alternatives like SFTP, coupled with access control and logging, can help prevent
                    misuse.

                <h3>Dumpster Diving</h3>
                <p>
                    Not all internal threats are digital. Dumpster diving refers to the act of digging through physical
                    trash to find sensitive documents or hardware that was improperly discarded.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An attacker could recover printed emails, old reports, or USB drives thrown into the bin without
                        shredding or wiping.</li>
                    <li>Even things like sticky notes with passwords or access codes can be valuable to someone digging
                        through the trash.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Proper document disposal policies and shred bins are simple but effective countermeasures.

                <h3>Shoulder Surfing</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, all it takes to breach a system is a good set of eyes. Shoulder surfing involves watching
                    someone enter passwords, read confidential screens, or type sensitive information — often without
                    them noticing.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This can happen in open office layouts, cafes, elevators, or even during meetings.</li>
                    <li>Insiders might memorize access credentials or take photos discreetly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Privacy filters, awareness training, and auto-lock policies for unattended computers help reduce
                    this threat.
                </p>

            <h3>Bringing It All Together</h3>
            <p>
                Internal attacks don’t always look like "hacks" — they’re often subtle, low-tech, and driven by everyday
                tools. What makes them especially dangerous is the attacker’s access and knowledge of the system.
                Whether it's through emails, devices, messengers, or even physical observation, understanding these
                internal threats helps organizations build layered defenses. Combining technology with employee
                awareness is the key to keeping internal security strong.

            <h2>Understanding DoS (Denial of Service) Attacks</h2>

            <p>
                Imagine trying to enter a shop, but someone keeps blocking the doorway so customers can’t get in. That’s
                what a Denial of Service (DoS) attack does to websites or online services — it overwhelms them with fake
                traffic or corrupted requests so that real users can’t use them.
            </p>

            <p>
                DoS attacks come in different flavors, and each one targets the system in a unique way. Let’s walk
                through the most common types and see how they work.
            </p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Ping of Death</h3>
                <p>
                    This attack sends oversized or malformed packets using the ping command. Normally, a computer can
                    handle
                    pings easily. But when it's flooded with these abnormal packets, it gets confused and crashes or
                    freezes. It’s like someone sending you a puzzle with missing pieces — over and over again — until
                    your
                    brain gives up!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Teardrop Attack</h3>
                <p>
                    In this attack, the data packets sent to a computer are broken into fragments — but not properly.
                    When
                    the system tries to put them back together, it fails and may crash. Think of trying to solve a
                    jigsaw
                    puzzle with wrongly shaped pieces that can’t fit — frustrating, right?
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>SYN Flooding</h3>
                <p>
                    This one takes advantage of how two computers start a conversation using a process called a
                    "three-way
                    handshake." The attacker floods the target with half-finished connections, never completing the
                    handshake. This leaves the server hanging and eventually runs out of space to handle real users.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: Attacker sends a SYN request (says "Hi!")</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Server replies with SYN-ACK ("Hi back!")</li>
                    <li>Step 3: But the attacker never replies with ACK — leaving the server waiting</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This keeps happening until the server is too busy to talk to anyone else.
                </p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Land Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    A land attack sends a fake request to the server where the source and destination IP addresses are
                    the
                    same — it tricks the system into talking to itself endlessly. It’s like calling your own number and
                    getting stuck in a loop with yourself!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Smurf Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    This one is clever. The attacker spoofs (fakes) their IP address and sends a ping request to many
                    devices, asking them to reply to the victim’s IP. Suddenly, the victim is flooded with replies from
                    hundreds or thousands of devices.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The attacker sends an ICMP (ping) request to a broadcast address.</li>
                    <li>All devices on that network reply to the victim’s IP.</li>
                    <li>The victim gets overwhelmed with responses they didn’t ask for.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>UDP Flooding</h3>
                <p>
                    Here, the attacker bombards the target with tons of UDP packets on random ports. The system keeps
                    looking for applications to handle these messages — and when it can’t find them, it replies with
                    errors,
                    which eats up resources fast.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Hybrid DoS Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    Some attackers mix multiple types of attacks at once — maybe combining SYN flooding with a ping
                    flood or
                    mixing low and high-level techniques. These are harder to detect because they use more than one
                    strategy
                    to break the system.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Application-Specific Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    These target particular applications like a web server, database, or login page. Instead of
                    attacking
                    the whole network, they hit the part of the app that does the most work — making it slow or
                    completely
                    unusable.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    DDoS is like a mega version of DoS. Instead of one attacker, many devices (often hacked ones called
                    a
                    “botnet”) work together to flood the target. It’s like hundreds of people trying to enter a small
                    store
                    all at once — no one else can get in, and the system collapses.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>These attacks are usually launched from thousands of infected computers.</li>
                    <li>They can take down large websites, online stores, and even government services.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                Defending against DoS and DDoS attacks is super important because these attacks don’t just crash
                websites — they cost money, damage trust, and sometimes even threaten critical services.
