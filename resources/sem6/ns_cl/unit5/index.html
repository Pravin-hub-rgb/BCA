            <li>When we talk about cybersecurity, one of the most important things to understand is how systems are
                attacked — these methods are known as attack vectors. In simple terms, an attack vector is the path or
                technique used by a hacker to break into a system or cause harm. In this unit, we’ll explore different
                categories of attack vectors that every IT or security student should know.</li>
            <li>We’ll start with Buffer Overflow Attacks, which are more technical and involve manipulating memory to
                crash a system or take control of it — things like stack overflows, string overflows, and even heap or
                integer overflows fall under this.</li>
            <li>Then we’ll move into Internal Attacks, which are all about threats that come from within the
                organization or through common user channels — like suspicious emails, mobile apps, instant messengers,
                and even physical methods like dumpster diving or shoulder surfing.</li>
            <li>Finally, we’ll cover Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks, which are designed to overwhelm or crash systems
                so that real users can't access them. This includes notorious attacks like Ping of Death, SYN flooding,
                and even modern Distributed DoS (DDoS) methods that use multiple devices to attack at once.</li>

                <h2>Understanding Buffer Overflow Attacks</h2>
                <p>
                    Buffer overflow attacks are a classic yet serious type of security vulnerability, especially in
                    low-level languages like C and C++. These attacks happen when a program writes more data into a
                    memory buffer than it was meant to hold. But why is that so dangerous?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In most systems, memory is organized in predictable ways. If too much data spills into the wrong
                    place, it can overwrite critical information — like where the program should go next. In some cases,
                    attackers can even insert their own code and take control of the program.
                </p>

                <h3>Types of Buffer Overflow Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    Let’s break down the different ways buffer overflows can happen, and how attackers use them.
                </p>

                <div class="in">
                    <h4>1. Stack Overflows</h4>
                    <p>
                        The stack is where your program stores local variables and keeps track of function calls. It
                        works like a stack of plates — last-in, first-out (LIFO). A stack overflow occurs when too much
                        data is pushed onto this stack.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attackers often aim to overwrite the return address stored on the stack.</li>
                        <li>They do this by overflowing a local buffer (like a character array) with their own data.
                        </li>
                        <li>When the function finishes and tries to return, it jumps to the attacker's code instead of
                            the original location.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This is one of the most common and dangerous types of buffer overflow. That’s why unsafe
                        functions like <code>gets()</code> or <code>strcpy()</code> (which don’t check input size) are
                        avoided in secure coding.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="in">
                    <h4>2. String Overflows</h4>
                    <p>
                        String overflows are a type of buffer overflow where unbounded input overflows a string buffer.
                        These are especially common in C-style strings (null-terminated character arrays).
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a function copies too many characters into a fixed-size string buffer, it can overwrite
                            nearby memory.</li>
                        <li>This can crash the program, corrupt data, or open up security holes — just like a stack
                            overflow.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        One of the first big internet worms — the Morris Worm — used string overflow to spread. That’s
                        why functions like <code>strncpy()</code> and proper input validation are important.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="in">
                    <h4>3. Heap Overflows</h4>
                    <p>
                        The heap is used for dynamically allocated memory — the kind created with <code>malloc()</code>
                        or <code>new</code>. Heap overflows happen when data written to the heap goes beyond its
                        allocated space.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These don’t overwrite return addresses but can corrupt things like heap metadata or function
                            pointers.</li>
                        <li>This allows attackers to change how the program works or even execute their own code.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Heap overflows are trickier to exploit than stack overflows, but just as dangerous. Luckily,
                        modern protections like heap canaries help detect and prevent them.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="in">
                    <h4>4. Integer Overflows</h4>
                    <p>
                        Integer overflows occur when a calculation exceeds the maximum value a variable type can store.
                        Alone, they aren’t buffer overflows — but they often lead to one.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, if a program calculates a buffer size using a multiplication that overflows,
                            the result may be too small.</li>
                        <li>Then, when it tries to store a large amount of data in the too-small buffer, a buffer
                            overflow happens.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These bugs are easy to overlook but can be a stepping stone to more serious vulnerabilities.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Protecting Against Buffer Overflow Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    Developers and security teams use several strategies to prevent buffer overflows. Here’s how they
                    keep things safe:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1. Write Safe Code:</strong> Always check input sizes and use safer functions. Don’t
                        blindly trust user input — always validate it!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>2. Use Memory Safety Features:</strong> Techniques like ASLR (Address Space Layout
                        Randomization) make it harder for attackers to predict where their code will land. Marking
                        memory as non-executable also helps stop attacks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>3. Use Static and Dynamic Analysis Tools:</strong> These tools scan your code (either
                        while writing or during testing) to catch buffer overflow bugs early.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>4. Sandboxing:</strong> Running programs in a restricted environment limits damage if
                        something goes wrong.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>5. Monitor Runtime Behavior:</strong> Some systems watch how programs behave as they
                        run. If something suspicious happens — like weird memory access — they can stop the program
                        before it causes harm.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Real-World Examples of Buffer Overflow Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    These attacks aren’t just theoretical. Let’s look at some famous real-world cases where buffer
                    overflows caused serious damage:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stack Overflow – Morris Worm (1988):</strong> One of the first internet worms used a
                        stack buffer overflow in the <code>finger</code> service on Unix to execute remote code and
                        spread rapidly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>String Overflow – Microsoft IIS Unicode Bug (2001):</strong> A long Unicode string in a
                        web request caused a buffer overflow in Microsoft’s web server, leading to full server
                        compromise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Heap Overflow – Microsoft Windows GDI+ (2004):</strong> A flaw in how Windows handled
                        image files allowed attackers to execute code just by tricking users into opening a malicious
                        JPG.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Integer Overflow – Apple's "goto fail" & Adobe Flash:</strong> Integer overflows in
                        Apple and Adobe software caused memory mismanagement, leading to code injection via malicious
                        video or network data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These examples show that buffer overflow vulnerabilities can affect any system — from personal
                    computers to massive web servers. That’s why secure coding, proper testing, and memory protection
                    features are absolutely essential.

                    When we think of cyberattacks, we often picture hackers trying to break in from the outside. But surprisingly, some of the most serious security threats come from within the organization itself. These are known as <strong>internal attacks</strong> — and they’re especially risky because the attacker usually has legitimate access and is trusted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Internal threats can come from employees, contractors, or even careless behavior. Let’s take a closer look at how common tools like emails, mobile phones, or even trash bins can be misused to compromise security.

                    <h3>Emails</h3>
                    <p>
                        Email is a vital tool for communication — and unfortunately, it’s also one of the easiest ways for insiders to cause damage.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An employee might attach confidential files and send them to a personal or competitor's email address.</li>
                        <li>Even well-intentioned staff can be tricked by phishing emails that appear to come from internal sources but are actually crafted to steal login credentials.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        To stay protected, organizations rely on tools like email monitoring, employee training, and data loss prevention (DLP) systems.

                    <p>
                        Smartphones are everywhere — and while they make life easier, they also introduce security risks inside the workplace.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Someone could take pictures of confidential screens or documents.</li>
                        <li>Phones can be connected to computers via USB or Bluetooth to transfer data without permission.</li>
                        <li>Some apps, if granted access, could secretly record conversations or track keystrokes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        That’s why many companies use Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions and limit phone use in sensitive areas.

                        FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer files quickly — but it can also be misused by insiders.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Someone might upload private company documents to an external FTP server under their control.</li>

                        Not all threats involve computers. Dumpster diving means going through physical trash to find sensitive materials that were thrown away carelessly.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Someone could retrieve printed emails, reports, or even old USB drives from the trash.</li>

                        Simple steps like shredding documents and using secure disposal bins can prevent such risks.

                    <h3>Shoulder Surfing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, all an attacker needs is to quietly watch someone at work. Shoulder surfing involves observing a person as they enter passwords, view sensitive data, or type private information — often without realizing they're being watched.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This can happen in shared offices, elevators, or even coffee shops.</li>
                        <li>Insiders might memorize or photograph what they see for later use.</li>

                    <p>
                        Using screen privacy filters, auto-lock settings, and training employees to stay alert can reduce this kind of risk.

                <h3>Bringing It All Together</h3>
                <p>
                    Internal attacks aren’t always high-tech hacks — they’re often subtle, everyday actions that go unnoticed. What makes them dangerous is that the person involved often knows the system and already has access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From emails and mobile devices to physical trash and peeking eyes, there are many ways an insider threat can take shape. That’s why building a strong defense means not just using the right tools, but also creating a culture of awareness among employees.

                <p>
                    Imagine trying to enter a shop, but someone keeps blocking the doorway so customers can’t get in. That’s
                    exactly what a Denial of Service (DoS) attack does to websites or online services — it overwhelms them with
                    fake traffic or corrupted requests, preventing real users from accessing them.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    DoS attacks come in various types, each targeting the system in a unique way. Let’s explore some of the most
                    common kinds and how they work.

                    <p>
                        This attack floods a system with oversized or malformed packets using the ping command. While a computer
                        usually handles pings without issue, being bombarded with abnormal packets causes it to crash or freeze.
                        Think of it like receiving a puzzle with missing pieces repeatedly until you just can’t solve it anymore!

                        sends many half-open connection requests but never completes them. This leaves the server waiting,
                        eventually running out of resources to serve legitimate users.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Step 1: Attacker sends a SYN request (saying "Hi!")</li>
                        <li>Step 2: Server replies with SYN-ACK ("Hi back!")</li>
                        <li>Step 3: Attacker never responds with ACK, leaving the server hanging</li>

                        devices (called a "botnet") flood the target simultaneously. Imagine hundreds of people trying to enter a
                        small shop at once — no one else can get in, and the system collapses.
