            <li>So far, you’ve seen how data mining works with structured data — like numbers, categories, and clearly organized tables. But in the real world, data comes in all shapes and sizes, and that’s where the advanced features of data mining come into play.</li>
            <li>This unit explores how we mine complex and unstructured data types that go way beyond spreadsheets. We begin by looking at complex data objects — which could include combinations of text, images, spatial data, and more. Then we dig into specialized databases, such as spatial databases (used in mapping and GPS), multimedia databases (involving images, audio, video), and time series or sequence data (used in stock markets, weather forecasts, and biological sequences).</li>
            <li>We also touch on the exciting area of text mining, which is all about extracting meaning from large volumes of unstructured text — think emails, documents, or social media posts. Finally, we wrap up with mining the World Wide Web, where we explore how search engines and recommendation systems use data mining techniques to make sense of the massive, messy information available online.</li>
