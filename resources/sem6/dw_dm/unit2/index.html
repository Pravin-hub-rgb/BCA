                <h3>2-Tier Architecture</h3>

                <p>The <strong>2-Tier Architecture</strong> is a client-server architecture commonly used in database
                    systems, including data warehouses. In this setup, the system is divided into two layers: the client
                    layer (end-user layer) and the server layer (data source layer). It is a simpler, faster
                    architecture but has limitations when dealing with large-scale systems.</p>

                <h4>Key Features of 2-Tier Architecture</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Client-Server Architecture:</strong> In this model, the client (end-user) directly
                        communicates with the server, where the data is stored and managed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Available Sources:</strong> The server layer may include sources like operational
                        databases, external data systems, or an existing data warehouse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not Expandable:</strong> This architecture is typically not expandable in terms of
                        handling large numbers of end users or big datasets efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited User Support:</strong> It struggles to support large numbers of concurrent users
                        due to limited scalability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy to Maintain:</strong> As it has only two layers, maintenance is simpler and quicker
                        compared to more complex architectures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast Communication:</strong> Direct communication between the client and server allows
                        faster data transfer and response times.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How It Works</h4>

                <p>In a 2-Tier architecture, the client (end-user) sends a request to the server, which processes the
                    request, retrieves the necessary data from the data source, and sends a response back to the client.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A retail company’s data warehouse uses a 2-tier architecture. The sales
                    team (client) directly queries the database (server) for daily sales data. The system processes the
                    query and provides the requested data to the sales team.</p>

                <h4>Diagram of 2-Tier Architecture</h4>
                <img src="../../images/dw4.jpeg" alt="">
                <p><strong>1. End-User Layer:</strong> This represents the clients (end-users) who request information
                    from the system.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Server Layer:</strong> The server processes the client’s request and interacts with the
                    data source (data warehouse or database) to retrieve the necessary data.</p>

                <p><strong>Example scenario:</strong> A manager (end-user) requests a sales report. The client sends a
                    query to the server. The server queries the database for the required data and returns the report to
                    the manager.</p>

                <p>The 2-tier architecture is ideal for smaller systems that do not require handling a large number of
                    concurrent users or complex data. It is easy to implement, provides fast communication, and is
                    simple to maintain. However, it is not expandable and does not support large-scale data processing,
                    making it unsuitable for organizations that need to scale up.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Small to medium-sized systems with limited data volume and user
                        traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not ideal for:</strong> Large-scale systems with complex data or a large number of
                        users.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3-Tier Architecture</h3>

                <p>The <strong>3-Tier Architecture</strong> is one of the most widely used architectures in data
                    warehousing. It divides the system into three distinct layers: the bottom tier (Database), the
                    middle tier (OLAP Server), and the top tier (Client Layer). This architecture is designed to provide
                    a scalable, efficient solution for handling large volumes of data and numerous end-users.</p>

                <h4>Key Features of 3-Tier Architecture</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most Widely Used:</strong> The 3-tier architecture is the most common setup for
                        enterprise-level data warehouses because it provides scalability, flexibility, and supports
                        large-scale data operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> It separates data management, business logic, and user
                        interaction into distinct layers, making the system more organized and easier to maintain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The architecture can handle a growing number of users and
                        increasing data volumes efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Each tier can be optimized independently for performance and
                        scalability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <img src="../../images/dw5.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>In a 3-tier architecture, data flows through three layers:</p>

                <h3>1️⃣ Bottom Tier: Database (RDBMS)</h3>

                <p>The bottom tier is where the <strong>data resides</strong>. It is typically a relational database
                    management system (RDBMS) like <strong>Oracle, SQL Server, or MySQL</strong>. In this layer, raw
                    data is cleaned, transformed, and loaded (ETL process) before being stored for analysis.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> The raw data is cleaned to remove inconsistencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> The data is transformed into a consistent format for
                        analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> After cleaning and transformation, the data is stored in tables
                        or other structures for efficient querying.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A company’s sales data, after being cleaned (removing invalid entries like
                    incorrect transaction dates) and transformed (standardizing the format), is loaded into the database
                    for analysis.</p>

                <h3>2️⃣ Middle Tier: OLAP Server</h3>

                <p>The middle tier is the <strong>OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) server</strong>, which is
                    responsible for performing business logic and processing queries. The OLAP server provides
                    multidimensional analysis capabilities, allowing users to perform complex queries efficiently.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Business Logic:</strong> This layer applies rules and logic for aggregating and
                        transforming data according to business needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multidimensional Analysis:</strong> The OLAP server enables data to be analyzed across
                        different dimensions, like time, geography, and product categories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Query Processing:</strong> It processes user queries quickly, using indexing and caching
                        to speed up response times.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A manager queries sales performance by region, time period, and product
                    category. The OLAP server retrieves and aggregates the data from the database based on these
                    dimensions.</p>


                <h3>3️⃣ Top Tier: Front-End Client Layer (Query Tools)</h3>

                <p>The top tier consists of <strong>front-end client tools</strong> that allow end-users to interact
                    with the system. These tools are used for querying, reporting, and analysis. The front-end tools
                    include tools like <strong>BI tools (Business Intelligence), reporting tools, and custom
                        dashboards</strong>.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Provides a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to
                        interact with the data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Query Tools:</strong> Allows users to run queries, generate reports, and visualize data.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Access to OLAP Server:</strong> The client tools communicate with the OLAP server to
                        fetch the processed data and present it to the user.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A business analyst uses a reporting tool (like Tableau or Power BI) to
                    visualize sales data by region and create interactive reports for management.</p>


                <p>The 3-tier architecture provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale data management and
                    analysis. By separating the system into three layers, organizations can optimize each layer for its
                    specific function, making the system efficient and flexible.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Large organizations with complex data and multiple users requiring
                        advanced analytical capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not ideal for:</strong> Small systems or organizations with limited resources.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>4-Tier Architecture</h3>

                <p>The <strong>4-Tier Architecture</strong> is a more advanced and flexible architecture used in data
                    management and application development. It divides the system into four distinct layers: Database,
                    Application, Presentation, and Client. This architecture allows for more separation of concerns,
                    better scalability, and improved performance when dealing with complex systems.</p>

                <h4>Key Features of 4-Tier Architecture</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increased Separation of Concerns:</strong> By adding the presentation layer and
                        separating the business logic from the data access, it enables easier management of each
                        component.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> The architecture supports scaling up and down as needed by managing
                        different layers independently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible and Maintainable:</strong> Each layer can be developed and maintained
                        independently, which makes it easier to implement changes without affecting the whole system.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> The layers are isolated, which can lead to improved security
                        by limiting access to sensitive data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How It Works</h4>

                <p>In the 4-Tier Architecture, the system is divided into four layers that interact with each other in a
                    sequential flow:</p>



                <h3>1️⃣ Database Layer</h3>

                <p>The <strong>Database Layer</strong> is the bottom-most layer and holds the data for the system. This
                    layer typically includes a relational database management system (RDBMS), where raw data is stored
                    and managed.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Raw data is stored in the database in a structured format.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Access:</strong> This layer is responsible for providing data to the application
                        layer through data access mechanisms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Ensures that the data is accurate and consistent.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A company’s employee records are stored in a database, including personal
                    information, salary details, and job history.</p>



                <h3>2️⃣ Application Layer</h3>

                <p>The <strong>Application Layer</strong> is where the business logic is implemented. This layer acts as
                    the intermediary between the database and the client, processing data and managing transactions.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Business Logic:</strong> Handles the core functionality, processing user requests and
                        ensuring that data is manipulated according to the business rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Manipulation:</strong> This layer retrieves data from the database, processes it,
                        and sends it to the presentation layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Objects:</strong> Contains business-related data structures that are used to
                        carry out specific business operations.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The business logic could include rules for calculating employee bonuses
                    based on performance, experience, and salary.</p>



                <h3>3️⃣ Presentation Layer</h3>

                <p>The <strong>Presentation Layer</strong> is the interface between the application and the end user. It
                    is responsible for presenting data to the user and receiving input from the client (user).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Controller:</strong> The controller receives the user input from the client, processes
                        the data, and sends requests to the business logic layer for further processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>View:</strong> The view is responsible for rendering the data from the business logic
                        layer in a format that the user can interact with, such as a web page or application screen.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> The presentation layer provides the user interface, allowing
                        users to interact with the system and make requests.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A user views their employee information on a webpage. The controller sends
                    a request to the business logic to fetch the necessary data, and the view displays the data on the
                    screen.</p>



                <h3>4️⃣ Client Layer</h3>

                <p>The <strong>Client Layer</strong> is where the user interacts with the system. It is typically a
                    user’s device (like a desktop, tablet, or smartphone) that communicates with the system to access
                    the application.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> The client layer allows users to make requests and interact
                        with the application through input forms, buttons, and other interface components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication with Presentation Layer:</strong> The client communicates with the
                        presentation layer to submit queries and receive responses.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A user opens a web browser and logs into the company’s HR portal, which is
                    the client interacting with the application layers behind the scenes.</p>

                <h3>Diagram</h3>
                <img src="../../images/dw6.jpeg" alt="">
                <ul>

                    <li>In the 4-Tier Architecture, when a user makes a request, it is first sent to the Presentation
                        Layer where the Controller receives the request. The controller processes the request and
                        forwards it to the Business Logic (or Business Objects) for further handling. From there, it
                        moves to the Data Access Layer, where it fetches the relevant data from the Database. Once the
                        data is retrieved, it is sent back to the Application Layer and passed to the Model, which
                        processes it according to the business rules. Finally, the processed data moves back to the View
                        in the Presentation Layer, where it is formatted and displayed to the user. This flow ensures
                        that each layer performs its specific function, providing an organized, efficient process for
                        data retrieval and presentation to the user.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The 4-tier architecture is an advanced, flexible approach to managing large, complex systems. By
                    splitting the architecture into four distinct layers, it allows for better separation of concerns,
                    scalability, and easier maintenance. It is ideal for applications that require high levels of
                    performance, security, and user interaction.</p>

        <p><strong>Basic Walk-through of OLTP and OLAP</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Before diving into OLAP, we need to understand OLTP because they are two sides of the same coin. OLTP,
                or Online Transaction Processing, is what keeps businesses running daily; it’s the system that handles
                real-time transactions like bank transfers, hotel bookings, and product purchases on Amazon. Every time
                you buy something online, OLTP ensures your order is placed, the inventory updates, and your payment
                goes through instantly. These systems prioritize speed and efficiency, handling thousands (or even
                millions) of transactions every second. To maintain consistency and avoid duplication, OLTP databases
                are designed using a highly structured, normalized format.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, businesses don’t just need to process transactions; they also need to analyze them to
                make decisions. That’s where OLAP, or Online Analytical Processing, comes in. Instead of focusing on
                individual transactions, OLAP looks at data trends over time. Imagine Amazon wanting to analyze last
                year’s sales to understand which products were most popular, which regions had the highest demand, or
                how discounts affected revenue. This kind of in-depth analysis isn’t possible with OLTP because OLTP
                systems are designed for fast transactions, not complex queries. OLAP, in contrast, is optimized for
                analysis and stores data in a way that makes it easy to explore different angles; like total sales per
                month, per city, or even per product category. Instead of the strict, normalized structure of OLTP, OLAP
                databases are often denormalized to improve query performance.</li>
            <li>Since OLAP is all about analyzing large datasets, it supports different operations to make querying
                easier. If a company wants to see total sales at a higher level (like total sales per country instead of
                per city), they can use a roll-up operation. But if they want more details, they can drill down to see
                city-wise or even store-wise sales. Similarly, they can slice the data to focus on a particular time
                period or dice it to filter multiple dimensions at once (e.g., sales in 2023 for a specific product
                category). These operations help businesses get exactly the insights they need from their data.</li>
            <li>Now, OLAP itself comes in different types based on how data is stored. ROLAP (Relational OLAP) works
                directly with relational databases like SQL, allowing for flexible but slower queries. MOLAP
                (Multidimensional OLAP) stores data in precomputed OLAP cubes, making it much faster but requiring more
                storage. HOLAP (Hybrid OLAP) combines both approaches, keeping summary data in cubes for quick access
                while allowing more detailed analysis in relational tables when needed.</li>
            <li>The real reason businesses invest in OLAP is its ability to support decision-making. While OLTP is
                necessary for everyday transactions, it doesn’t help in strategic planning. That’s why companies use
                OLAP to study customer behavior, optimize pricing, and even predict future trends. Without OLAP,
                organizations would struggle to turn raw transaction data into meaningful insights.</li>
            <li>To make OLAP practical, different tools are used to query, visualize, and interpret the data. Some
                tools, like Tableau and Power BI, allow businesses to generate interactive reports. Others, like Excel
                PivotTables, help users analyze multidimensional data without needing technical expertise. Many modern
                OLAP systems now run on cloud-based platforms like Google BigQuery or AWS Redshift, allowing companies
                to analyze massive datasets in real-time over the internet.</li>
            <li>In short, OLTP and OLAP are both essential, but they serve different purposes; OLTP focuses on speed and
                accuracy in transaction processing, while OLAP is all about data analysis and business insights. They
                work together to help organizations run efficiently while also making informed decisions for the future.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>OLTP</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) refers to systems that manage real-time transactions, like bank
                    transfers or online shopping payments. These systems are designed to handle large numbers of quick
                    transactions efficiently.</li>
                <li>The main focus of OLTP systems is to store, retrieve, and update data quickly. They ensure
                    <strong>fast
                        query processing</strong> (retrieving results quickly), maintain <strong>data integrity</strong>
                    (keeping data accurate
                    and consistent), and support multiple users accessing the same data at the same time.
                </li>
                <li>OLTP systems are responsible for handling the <strong>daily operations</strong> of an organization,
                    such as
                    booking a ticket, updating inventory, or processing a sale.</li>
                <li>Since these systems support <strong>simple database queries</strong> (basic search operations), the
                    response time
                    for any user action is <strong>very fast</strong>.</li>
                <li>They are characterized by a <strong>large number of short online transactions</strong> (like
                    inserting, updating,
                    or deleting records in a database).</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Challenges of an OLTP system:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since multiple users can access and modify data at the same time, OLTP systems need
                        <strong>concurrency control</strong> (a method to manage multiple requests without errors) and a
                        <strong>recovery
                            mechanism</strong> (a way to restore data in case of failure) to prevent issues like data
                        conflicts or
                        system crashes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>OLAP is a category of software that helps analysts, managers, and executives gain insights into data
                    by providing <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>consistent</strong>, and <strong>interactive</strong>
                    access to information. This data is transformed from raw data into a more <strong>meaningful
                        format</strong> that reflects the different aspects of a business, as understood by the user.
                </li>
                <li>OLAP is typically characterized by a <strong>relatively low volume of transactions</strong> (fewer,
                    but more complex, data operations compared to OLTP systems).</li>
                <li>Queries in OLAP systems are often <strong>very complex</strong> and involve
                    <strong>aggregations</strong> (combining data to get summaries, like total sales over a year). For
                    OLAP systems, <strong>response time</strong> (how quickly the system gives results) is an important
                    measure of how effective the system is.
                </li>
                <li>OLAP applications are commonly used with <strong>data mining techniques</strong> (methods to
                    discover patterns and trends from large data sets) to analyze historical data and make predictions.
                </li>
                <li>In OLAP, data is stored in a <strong>multi-dimensional schema</strong> (a way of organizing data
                    across multiple dimensions, like time, location, product). This schema is often a <strong>star
                        schema</strong> (a simple structure where one central table is connected to multiple other
                    tables, like a star). The data is usually <strong>aggregated</strong> (summarized) and historical,
                    helping with trend analysis and decision-making.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>OLAP Operations</h3>
                <p>OLAP operations help analyze data in different ways by allowing users to explore information from
                    various angles. These operations make it easier to summarize data, look at detailed records, filter
                    specific information, or rearrange data for better insights. Some common OLAP operations include
                    Drill Down, Roll Up, Slice, Dice, and Pivot.</p>

                <h3>1: Drill Down</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drill down is an operation that <strong>converts less detailed data into highly detailed
                            data</strong>. In
                        simple terms, it helps you go deeper into the data to see more specific details.</li>
                    <li>It can be done in two ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Moving down in the concept hierarchy</strong> (a structured way of organizing
                                data, like
                                going from a general level to a more specific level, such as from "Year" to "Quarter" to
                                "Month").</li>
                            <li><strong>Adding a new dimension</strong> (introducing another factor to analyze, such as
                                including
                                "Region" along with "Time" for a more detailed view).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>For example, in the data cube shown below, the drill-down operation is performed by
                        <strong>moving
                            down in the time dimension</strong>; from "Quarter" to "Month," giving a more detailed
                        breakdown of the
                        data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/dw11.jpeg" alt="Drill Down Example">
                <h3>2: Roll Up</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Roll up is the <strong>opposite of the drill-down operation</strong>. Instead of going into more
                        detail, it
                        <strong>summarizes data at a higher level</strong> by combining smaller data points into a
                        broader view.
                    </li>
                    <li>It performs <strong>aggregation</strong> (grouping and summarizing data, like calculating total
                        sales for a
                        year instead of showing sales for each month) on the OLAP cube.</li>
                    <li>Roll up can be done in two ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Climbing up in the concept hierarchy</strong> (moving from a detailed level to a
                                broader
                                level, such as from "City" to "Country").</li>
                            <li><strong>Reducing the number of dimensions</strong> (removing one or more factors from
                                analysis to
                                simplify the data view).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>For example, in the data cube shown below, the roll-up operation is performed by
                        <strong>climbing up
                            in the location dimension</strong>—moving from "City" to "Country" to get a higher-level
                        summary of the
                        data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/dw12.jpeg" alt="Roll Up Example">
                <h3>3: Dice</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dice is an OLAP operation that <strong>selects a smaller portion of data</strong> from the OLAP cube by
                        applying conditions on <strong>two or more dimensions</strong> (different factors of data, like time,
                        location, or product).</li>
                    <li>In simple terms, it <strong>creates a subcube</strong> (a smaller, filtered version of the main dataset) by
                        focusing on specific values in multiple dimensions.</li>
                    <li>For example, in the cube shown below, a subcube is selected based on the following criteria:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Location</strong> = "Delhi" or "Kolkata"</li>
                            <li><strong>Time</strong> = "Q1" or "Q2"</li>
                            <li><strong>Item</strong> = "Car" or "Bus"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/dw13.jpeg" alt="Dice Example">
                <h3>4: Slice</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Slice is an OLAP operation that <strong>selects data based on a single dimension</strong>, which results in the creation of a <strong>new subcube</strong> (a smaller portion of the data that focuses only on one specific value in a chosen dimension).</li>
    <li>In simple terms, it <strong>cuts out a specific section of data</strong> based on one condition while keeping the rest of the dimensions unchanged.</li>
    <li>For example, in the cube shown below, the slice operation is performed on the <strong>Time dimension</strong>, where <strong>Time = "Q1"</strong>. This means the new subcube will only contain data related to the first quarter (Q1), filtering out all other time periods.</li>
</ul>
