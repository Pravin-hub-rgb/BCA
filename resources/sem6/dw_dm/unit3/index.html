        <ul>
            <li>When we talk about Data Mining, we're basically talking about digging through huge amounts of data to
                find useful patterns, trends, or knowledge — sort of like finding gold in a mountain of rocks. This unit
                sets the stage by introducing you to the core ideas behind data mining and how it fits into the bigger
                picture of data analysis and business intelligence.</li>
            <li>We begin with the basic concepts, including what data mining really means, how it's different from (yet
                related to) KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases), and where it's used — from market research to fraud
                detection. Then we move into data mining primitives, which are like building blocks that help define
                what kind of patterns we want to find, what data is relevant, and how we measure our findings.</li>
            <li>Next, we explore data mining query languages, which allow us to express what kind of patterns we're
                interested in — whether it’s through specifying data, the kind of knowledge we want, how results should
                be visualized, or setting up hierarchies and structures. Finally, the unit wraps up with the
                architecture of data mining systems, explaining how everything works together behind the scenes — from
                data input to pattern output.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>1. Basic Concepts of Data Mining</h2>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>What is Data Mining?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data mining is like finding hidden patterns or useful insights from a huge pile of data. It
                        helps us understand what’s really going on behind the numbers—like trends, similarities, or odd
                        things that stand out. Think of it like a smart tool that uses maths and algorithms to turn
                        boring raw data into something meaningful so we can make better decisions.</li>
                    <li>Data mining is the smart process of uncovering useful patterns, relationships, or unusual
                        behaviors from large datasets. It uses a mix of statistics, machine learning, and database
                        techniques to find hidden trends that aren't obvious at first glance. Methods like
                        classification (grouping data), clustering (finding similar items), regression (predicting
                        values), and association rule mining (like "people who buy X also buy Y") are commonly used.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before mining begins, the data is usually cleaned and prepared. Then, different
                                algorithms are applied to analyze it. This process is iterative, which means we often
                                repeat steps—tweaking things and validating results—to make sure the insights are both
                                accurate and useful in real-world decisions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>KDD vs. Data Mining</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is the comprehensive process of extracting meaningful
                        knowledge from raw data, encompassing multiple stages from data preparation to pattern
                        interpretation. Data mining constitutes a critical step within the KDD process, specifically
                        focused on applying computational algorithms to identify patterns in prepared datasets. The
                        relationship between KDD and data mining is hierarchical, where data mining serves as the
                        analytical core embedded within the broader KDD framework.</li>
                    <li>The KDD process consists of five primary stages: data selection, preprocessing, transformation,
                        data mining, and interpretation/evaluation. Data selection involves identifying and retrieving
                        relevant datasets from various sources. Preprocessing cleanses the data by handling missing
                        values, removing noise, and resolving inconsistencies. Transformation converts the data into
                        appropriate formats through techniques like normalization or dimensionality reduction. Data
                        mining then applies algorithms to discover patterns, followed by interpretation where results
                        are assessed for validity and usefulness.</li>
                    <li>Data mining specifically refers to the algorithmic stage of KDD, employing techniques such as
                        classification, clustering, association rule mining, and outlier detection. These methods
                        operate on the transformed data to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, or anomalies. While
                        data mining focuses exclusively on pattern extraction, KDD encompasses the entire pipeline from
                        raw data to actionable knowledge, including pre- and post-processing stages that ensure data
                        quality and result relevance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key differences between KDD and data mining include:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Scope: KDD covers the complete knowledge extraction pipeline, while data mining focuses
                                on pattern discovery algorithms</li>
                            <li>Input: KDD begins with raw data, whereas data mining processes prepared datasets</li>
                            <li>Output: KDD produces actionable knowledge, while data mining generates patterns/models
                            </li>
                            <li>Techniques: KDD incorporates data management and statistical methods alongside mining
                                algorithms</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Data Mining Tools</h3>
                <p>Data mining tools are software applications designed to implement data mining techniques efficiently.
                    These tools provide functionalities for data preprocessing, algorithm execution, and result
                    visualization. Common tools include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python/R Libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, dplyr) for custom algorithm implementation</li>
                    <li>Weka for machine learning and predictive modeling</li>
                    <li>RapidMiner for workflow-based data mining</li>
                    <li>KNIME for visual programming and analytics</li>
                    <li>SQL-based tools (Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services) for database-integrated mining</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These tools typically support tasks such as data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and
                    performance evaluation. They often include built-in algorithms for classification, clustering, and
                    association analysis, reducing the need for manual coding.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Applications of Data Mining</h3>
                <p>Data mining is applied across various domains to solve complex problems and optimize processes. Key
                    applications include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Business Intelligence: Market basket analysis, customer segmentation, and churn prediction</li>
                    <li>Healthcare: Disease pattern detection, drug efficacy analysis, and patient risk stratification
                    </li>
                    <li>Finance: Fraud detection, credit scoring, and stock market trend analysis</li>
                    <li>Manufacturing: Predictive maintenance, quality control, and supply chain optimization</li>
                    <li>Research: Scientific data analysis, hypothesis testing, and knowledge discovery</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In these applications, data mining techniques process historical or real-time data to generate
                    insights that support strategic decisions. The choice of method depends on the problem
                    type—supervised learning for labeled data, unsupervised learning for unlabeled data, and
                    reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making. Results are typically validated using metrics
                    like accuracy, precision, or F1-score to ensure reliability before deployment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The integration of data mining with big data technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) has expanded its
                        scalability, enabling analysis of massive datasets distributed across clusters. This combination
                        enhances processing speed and accommodates diverse data types, including text, images, and
                        sensor data.</li>
                    <li>Data mining continues to evolve with advancements in deep learning and automated machine
                        learning (AutoML), which reduce manual intervention in model selection and hyperparameter
                        tuning. However, challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and interpretability remain
                        critical considerations in its implementation.</li>

            <h2>2. Data Mining Query Languages (DMQLs)</h2>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>What Are Data Mining Query Languages?</h3>
                <p>Let's begin with a simple question:</p>
                <p>How do you "talk" to a data mining system and tell it exactly what patterns to find?</p>
                <p>Just like we use SQL to query databases, we use Data Mining Query Languages (DMQLs) to query mining
                    systems. These languages provide a structured way to define:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What data to analyze</li>
                    <li>What patterns to look for</li>
                    <li>Any hierarchies involved</li>
                    <li>How results should be presented</li>
                </ul>
                <p>They help bridge the gap between raw data and meaningful knowledge.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Components of Data Mining Query Languages</h3>

            <div class="in">
                <h4>1. Data Specification</h4>
                <p>What it means: This part specifies which dataset, which table, or even which columns you want to
                    mine.</p>
                <p>Example (technical):</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>
USE sales_data;
SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE region = 'North';
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                <p>Why it matters: You may have 50 tables, but you might only want to mine patterns from
                    transactions where region = 'North'. This step helps filter the exact target data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h4>2. Specifying Kind of Knowledge to Be Mined</h4>
                <p>What it means: This defines the type of pattern or knowledge you're looking for. It could be:</p>
                <img src="../../images/dw18.svg" class="wb" alt="">
                <p>Example (DMQL-style):</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>
MINE CLASSIFICATION_RULES
FROM customer_data
FOR customer_type
BASED ON age, income, location;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h4>3. Hierarchy Specification</h4>
                <p>What it means: This part allows you to define multi-level data relationships, especially useful
                    in OLAP-style or multidimensional analysis.</p>
                <p>Why it's useful: Let's say your data has:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Product → Category → Department</li>
                    <li>Location → City → State → Country</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can specify that you want to mine patterns at the "state" level instead of just "city".</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>
DEFINE HIERARCHY location_hierarchy AS
(location < city < state < country);
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                <p>Now your queries can mine patterns like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Find top-selling product categories by state."</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h4>4. Pattern Presentation & Visualization Specification</h4>
                <p>What it means: This part tells the system how to show the results after mining.</p>
                <p>Why it matters: Raw patterns can be boring or too complex. So you can request:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rules (e.g., "If age > 25, then buys insurance")</li>
                    <li>Tables</li>
                    <li>Charts (bar/pie/scatter)</li>
                    <li>Decision trees</li>
                    <li>Cluster graphs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>
SHOW RESULTS AS decision_tree;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                <p>This makes the output more understandable for decision-makers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h4>5. Data Mining Languages (Actual DMQL Syntax)</h4>
                <p>This refers to the actual language or syntax used for mining queries. Some common ones:</p>
                <img src="../../images/dw19.svg" class="wb" alt="">
                <p>A typical DMQL syntax may look like:</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>
USE sales_data;
MINE association_rules
FROM transactions
FOR item
BASED ON item_list
WITH support ≥ 0.2, confidence ≥ 0.6;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                <p>This tells the system to mine association rules with certain thresholds.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h4>6. Standardization of Data Mining</h4>
                <p>What it means: Every tool has its own version of data mining syntax, which creates compatibility
                    issues.</p>
                <p>So the goal is: To create standardized languages and frameworks that work across platforms—just
                    like SQL is standardized for databases.</p>
                <p>Organizations involved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ISO (International Organization for Standardization)</li>
                    <li>DMG (Data Mining Group) – Created PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language)</li>
                    <li>W3C – Promoting data exchange formats</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Why it matters: Imagine you build a model in Oracle but want to use it in Python or
                    Excel—standardization allows that by defining universal data mining languages and models.</p>

                <h3>First Things First — What Are Data Mining Primitives?</h3>
                <p>Imagine you're placing an order for a pizza. You need to specify:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What kind of pizza you want</li>
                    <li>Where it should be delivered</li>
                    <li>How big you want it</li>
                    <li>And how spicy or cheesy</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In data mining, we do something similar. We tell the system what kind of data we want to analyze,
                    what we're trying to find, and how we want to measure success. These basic instructions are called
                    Data Mining Primitives.</p>
                <p>So in short:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data mining primitives are the basic building blocks or ingredients that help us specify a data
                        mining task clearly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These primitives help define what data to mine, what patterns to find, how to evaluate them, and how
                    to present them.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Let's Explore Each Part of Data Mining Primitives</h3>

                <div class="in">
                    <h4>1. Task-Relevant Data</h4>
                    <p>Basic Idea:</p>
                    <p>This simply means: Which data are we interested in?</p>
                    <p>Not all data is useful. So before mining, we have to pick the relevant columns, tables, and
                        conditions — just like how you'd filter out only 10th-grade student marks if you're analyzing
                        exam trends.</p>
                    <p>Technical Explanation:</p>
                    <p>Task-relevant data refers to the subset of data that is useful for the mining task. It can
                        include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Specific tables (e.g., sales)</li>
                        <li>Specific attributes (e.g., product_name, region, revenue)</li>
                        <li>Filtering conditions (e.g., WHERE year = 2024)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
SELECT product_name, region, revenue
FROM sales
WHERE year = 2024;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>You're saying: "Mine only this part of the data, not everything."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="in">
                    <h4>2. Mining Objectives</h4>
                    <p>Basic Idea:</p>
                    <p>Now that we know what data to look at, we need to define what we want to find.</p>
                    <p>Are we trying to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Group similar things? (Clustering)</li>
                        <li>Predict something? (Classification or regression)</li>
                        <li>Find patterns like "people who buy X also buy Y"? (Association rules)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That's what mining objectives define.</p>
                    <p>Technical Explanation:</p>
                    <p>Mining objectives define the type of knowledge to be mined. Examples:</p>
                    <img src="../../images/dw20.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                    <p>Example (DMQL-style):</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
MINE classification_rules
FROM customer_data
FOR customer_type
BASED ON age, income;
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    <h4>3. Measures and Identification of Patterns</h4>
                    <p>Basic Idea:</p>
                    <p>How do we know if a pattern is important or not? We need measures or criteria to decide that —
                        like saying "only show me patterns that happen frequently or are very confident".</p>
                    <p>Think of it like filtering only the most spicy memes instead of boring ones</p>
                    <p>Technical Explanation:</p>
                    <p>In data mining, we use objective measures like:</p>
                    <img src="../../images/dw21.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rule: If buys "milk" → buys "bread"</li>
                        <li>Support = 20%</li>
                        <li>Confidence = 80%</li>
                        <li>Lift = 1.5</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These values tell the system if a pattern is worth showing or just random noise.</p>

            <h2>4. Architectures of Data Mining Systems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Imagine this: in today’s world, billions of gigabytes of data are being created every single day
                    like videos, photos, messages, search queries, online transactions, and so much more. Now the big
                    question is—how do we make sense of all this data? How do we find exactly what we’re looking for,
                    without getting lost in this ocean of information?</li>
                <li>That’s where data mining comes in. Think of it like digging through a huge mountain of data to find
                    tiny gems of useful information. For example, when you search something on Google—say, “best laptops
                    under ₹50,000”—Google instantly gives you a list of results that are super relevant. But how does it
                    find those results out of billions of web pages?</li>
                <li>Well, it’s not magic—it’s data mining at work! And behind this data mining, there’s a complete
                    system that handles everything—collecting the data, processing it, organizing it, and finally
                    digging out what you actually need. The structure and working of this entire system is what we call
                    the architecture of a data mining system.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/dw17.svg" alt="">
            <p><strong>Data Mining System Architecture Overview</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The architecture of a data mining system is structured into distinct layers, each handling specific
                    functions while working together to process data and extract meaningful patterns. At the top is the
                    user interface, where users input queries and receive results. This layer connects directly to the
                    pattern evaluation component, which analyzes discovered patterns for relevance and significance by
                    referencing the knowledge base—a repository of domain-specific rules and prior knowledge.</li>
                <li>Beneath the pattern evaluation layer lies the data mining engine, the core processing unit that
                    applies various algorithms to identify patterns, correlations, or predictions in the data. The
                    engine interacts with the knowledge base to refine its operations and ensure alignment with
                    predefined criteria.</li>
                <li>Data for mining is supplied by the database or data warehouse server, which stores structured and
                    preprocessed information. Before reaching this server, raw data undergoes cleaning, integration, and
                    selection to remove inconsistencies, merge data from multiple sources, and filter only relevant
                    subsets for analysis.</li>
                <li>At the base of the architecture are the data sources, which include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Databases containing structured operational data</li>
                        <li>Data warehouses with consolidated historical records</li>
                        <li>The World Wide Web for external datasets</li>
                        <li>Other repositories such as documents or logs</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Data flows upward from these sources through the cleaning and integration layer, into the database
                    server, and finally to the mining engine for processing. Discovered patterns are evaluated before
                    being presented to the user via the interface. The knowledge base supports both pattern evaluation
                    and the mining engine by providing contextual rules and validation criteria.</li>
                <li>This layered design ensures efficient data handling, scalable processing, and accurate results,
                    making it a robust framework for extracting actionable insights from complex datasets. Each
                    component has a defined role, and their interactions enable the system to transform raw data into
                    valuable knowledge systematically.</li>
