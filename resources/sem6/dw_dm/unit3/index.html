        <ul>
            <li>When we talk about Data Mining, we're basically talking about digging through huge amounts of data to
                find useful patterns, trends, or knowledge — sort of like finding gold in a mountain of rocks. This unit
                sets the stage by introducing you to the core ideas behind data mining and how it fits into the bigger
                picture of data analysis and business intelligence.</li>
            <li>We begin with the basic concepts, including what data mining really means, how it's different from (yet
                related to) KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases), and where it's used — from market research to fraud
                detection. Then we move into data mining primitives, which are like building blocks that help define
                what kind of patterns we want to find, what data is relevant, and how we measure our findings.</li>
            <li>Next, we explore data mining query languages, which allow us to express what kind of patterns we're
                interested in — whether it’s through specifying data, the kind of knowledge we want, how results should
                be visualized, or setting up hierarchies and structures. Finally, the unit wraps up with the
                architecture of data mining systems, explaining how everything works together behind the scenes — from
                data input to pattern output.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>4. Architectures of Data Mining Systems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Imagine this: in today’s world, billions of gigabytes of data are being created every single day
                    like videos, photos, messages, search queries, online transactions, and so much more. Now the big
                    question is—how do we make sense of all this data? How do we find exactly what we’re looking for,
                    without getting lost in this ocean of information?</li>
                <li>That’s where data mining comes in. Think of it like digging through a huge mountain of data to find
                    tiny gems of useful information. For example, when you search something on Google—say, “best laptops
                    under ₹50,000”—Google instantly gives you a list of results that are super relevant. But how does it
                    find those results out of billions of web pages?</li>
                <li>Well, it’s not magic—it’s data mining at work! And behind this data mining, there’s a complete
                    system that handles everything—collecting the data, processing it, organizing it, and finally
                    digging out what you actually need. The structure and working of this entire system is what we call
                    the architecture of a data mining system.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Data Mining System Architecture Overview</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The architecture of a data mining system is structured into distinct layers, each handling specific
                    functions while working together to process data and extract meaningful patterns. At the top is the
                    user interface, where users input queries and receive results. This layer connects directly to the
                    pattern evaluation component, which analyzes discovered patterns for relevance and significance by
                    referencing the knowledge base—a repository of domain-specific rules and prior knowledge.</li>
                <li>Beneath the pattern evaluation layer lies the data mining engine, the core processing unit that
                    applies various algorithms to identify patterns, correlations, or predictions in the data. The
                    engine interacts with the knowledge base to refine its operations and ensure alignment with
                    predefined criteria.</li>
                <li>Data for mining is supplied by the database or data warehouse server, which stores structured and
                    preprocessed information. Before reaching this server, raw data undergoes cleaning, integration, and
                    selection to remove inconsistencies, merge data from multiple sources, and filter only relevant
                    subsets for analysis.</li>
                <li>At the base of the architecture are the data sources, which include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Databases containing structured operational data</li>
                        <li>Data warehouses with consolidated historical records</li>
                        <li>The World Wide Web for external datasets</li>
                        <li>Other repositories such as documents or logs</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Data flows upward from these sources through the cleaning and integration layer, into the database
                    server, and finally to the mining engine for processing. Discovered patterns are evaluated before
                    being presented to the user via the interface. The knowledge base supports both pattern evaluation
                    and the mining engine by providing contextual rules and validation criteria.</li>
                <li>This layered design ensures efficient data handling, scalable processing, and accurate results,
                    making it a robust framework for extracting actionable insights from complex datasets. Each
                    component has a defined role, and their interactions enable the system to transform raw data into
                    valuable knowledge systematically.</li>
