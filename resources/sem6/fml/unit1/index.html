            <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Machine Learning (ML) is a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps computers
                    learn from data and make decisions or predictions without needing explicit instructions
                    for every step. Instead of just following fixed rules, it finds patterns in data and
                    keeps improving over time.</li>
                <li>It works by using algorithms to process large amounts of data, recognize trends, and
                    refine its accuracy with experience. That’s why it's used in things like speech recognition,
                    recommendation systems, and even fraud detection.</li>
                <li>Ever noticed how YouTube suggests videos you might like or how online shopping sites
                    recommend products based on what you've browsed? That’s Machine Learning in action—analyzing
                    your past behavior to make smart suggestions without anyone manually programming each choice.</li>
                    <li>The Three Main Approaches to Machine Learning:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Supervised Learning</li>
                            <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
                            <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>1. Supervised Learning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where the algorithm is trained using
                        labeled data. This means that for every input, the correct output is already known, allowing
                        the model to learn patterns and relationships.</li>

                    <li>The process starts with feeding the algorithm structured data, where inputs and their
                        corresponding outputs are provided. Over time, it analyzes this data and learns to make
                        accurate predictions on new, unseen inputs.</li>

                    <li>This method is widely used in various applications, such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Determining property prices based on factors like location, size, and amenities.</li>
                            <li>Detecting spam emails by analyzing patterns in subject lines and content.</li>
                            <li>Interpreting handwritten numbers in banking or postal systems.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Since the model learns from labeled examples, its accuracy improves as more data is provided,
                        making it a powerful tool for predictive tasks.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>2.Unsupervised Learning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm works with data
                        that has no predefined labels or categories. Instead of being told what the correct
                        answers are, the model identifies patterns and relationships on its own.</li>

                    <li>The algorithm analyzes the data and groups similar items together based on shared
                        characteristics. It is often used for discovering hidden structures in large datasets
                        without human intervention.</li>

                    <li>Common real-world applications include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grouping customers with similar shopping behaviors for targeted marketing.</li>
                            <li>Detecting unusual patterns in financial transactions to identify fraud.</li>
                            <li>Organizing news articles into different categories based on content similarity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>This learning method is especially useful when dealing with vast amounts of data where
                        predefined labels are unavailable, making it an essential tool for data analysis and
                        pattern recognition.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>3. Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning approach where an agent learns by interacting
                        with an environment. Instead of being given direct answers, the agent takes actions and receives
                        feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</li>

                    <li>The goal is to maximize rewards over time by improving decision-making based on past
                        experiences. The agent continuously adjusts its strategy to achieve better outcomes.</li>

                    <li>Real-world applications of reinforcement learning include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teaching robots how to walk or perform tasks by learning from trial and error.</li>
                            <li>Training AI to play video games and improve its strategies through repeated gameplay.
                            </li>
                            <li>Optimizing stock trading strategies by learning from market fluctuations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>This method is highly effective for solving complex problems where the best solution is not
                        immediately obvious, making it widely used in automation, gaming, and robotics.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>In supervised learning, it's like teaching with examples. The algorithm gets both the input and the
                correct output, so it knows what the right answer is. It learns by making connections between the two,
                so it can predict the correct answer for new data. Now, in unsupervised learning, there are no correct
                answers given. The algorithm just gets the input data and has to figure out patterns or groupings all on
                its own. It’s like trying to make sense of a puzzle without knowing what the final picture looks like.
                Finally, in reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by doing. It takes actions, gets feedback in
                the form of rewards or penalties, and then adjusts to make better choices. It's like learning by trial
                and error, where it gets better the more it tries. So, while supervised learning needs both input and
                output, unsupervised learning only has input and figures things out, and reinforcement learning learns
                by interacting and improving from feedback.</p>
