            <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Machine Learning (ML) is a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps computers
                    learn from data and make decisions or predictions without needing explicit instructions
                    for every step. Instead of just following fixed rules, it finds patterns in data and
                    keeps improving over time.</li>
                <li>It works by using algorithms to process large amounts of data, recognize trends, and
                    refine its accuracy with experience. That’s why it's used in things like speech recognition,
                    recommendation systems, and even fraud detection.</li>
                <li>Ever noticed how YouTube suggests videos you might like or how online shopping sites
                    recommend products based on what you've browsed? That’s Machine Learning in action—analyzing
                    your past behavior to make smart suggestions without anyone manually programming each choice.</li>
                <li>The Three Main Approaches to Machine Learning:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Supervised Learning</li>
                        <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
                        <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>1. Supervised Learning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where the algorithm is trained using
                        labeled data. This means that for every input, the correct output is already known, allowing
                        the model to learn patterns and relationships.</li>

                    <li>The process starts with feeding the algorithm structured data, where inputs and their
                        corresponding outputs are provided. Over time, it analyzes this data and learns to make
                        accurate predictions on new, unseen inputs.</li>

                    <li>This method is widely used in various applications, such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Determining property prices based on factors like location, size, and amenities.</li>
                            <li>Detecting spam emails by analyzing patterns in subject lines and content.</li>
                            <li>Interpreting handwritten numbers in banking or postal systems.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Since the model learns from labeled examples, its accuracy improves as more data is provided,
                        making it a powerful tool for predictive tasks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here are some key supervised learning algorithms:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It is used to predict continuous values, such as house
                                prices or temperatures.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It tries to fit the best possible straight line through
                                the given data points, minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose we want to predict house prices based on the size of
                                the house. Linear regression will find a line that best represents how house size
                                affects price.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It is used for classification problems where the output
                                is either one category or another (e.g., Yes/No, Spam/Not Spam).</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Instead of a straight line, it uses a curve (logistic
                                function) that squashes values between 0 and 1, representing probabilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Email spam detection – logistic regression helps decide
                                whether an email is spam (1) or not spam (0) based on features like the number of links,
                                special characters, and sender information.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Decision Trees:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It makes predictions by breaking the data into smaller
                                and smaller groups based on certain conditions.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Imagine a flowchart where each question leads to a
                                different path. The tree splits the data at each step based on the most important
                                features, eventually leading to a final decision.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Predicting whether a customer will buy a product based on age,
                                income, and browsing history. The tree might start by checking age, then income, and so
                                on.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It is mainly used for classification, finding the best
                                possible boundary between different categories.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Imagine drawing a line that best separates two groups of
                                data points. SVM finds the "widest possible street" that keeps the groups apart.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Classifying images of cats and dogs. The algorithm finds the
                                best dividing line (or curve) that separates cat images from dog images.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It is inspired by how the human brain works and is used
                                to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It consists of layers of "neurons" that process
                                information and adjust their connections based on errors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Recognizing handwritten digits – the network learns from
                                thousands of digit images and then can identify new handwritten numbers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.Unsupervised Learning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm works with data
                        that has no predefined labels or categories. Instead of being told what the correct
                        answers are, the model identifies patterns and relationships on its own.</li>

                    <li>The algorithm analyzes the data and groups similar items together based on shared
                        characteristics. It is often used for discovering hidden structures in large datasets
                        without human intervention.</li>

                    <li>Common real-world applications include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grouping customers with similar shopping behaviors for targeted marketing.</li>
                            <li>Detecting unusual patterns in financial transactions to identify fraud.</li>
                            <li>Organizing news articles into different categories based on content similarity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>This learning method is especially useful when dealing with vast amounts of data where
                        predefined labels are unavailable, making it an essential tool for data analysis and
                        pattern recognition.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here are some key unsupervised learning algorithms:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It groups similar data points into a fixed number of
                                clusters (k).</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center
                                (centroid) and keeps adjusting the clusters to minimize the distance between points and
                                their assigned centroid.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Businesses use K-Means to group customers based on their
                                shopping behavior. For instance, some customers may prefer luxury products, while others
                                go for budget-friendly items.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Hierarchical Clustering:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Instead of fixing the number of clusters beforehand, it
                                builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to show how data points are related.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It either starts by treating each data point as its own
                                cluster and merging similar ones (bottom-up) or starts with all data points in one
                                cluster and keeps splitting them (top-down).</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Biologists use hierarchical clustering to group species based
                                on genetic similarity, creating a family tree of related organisms.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It reduces the number of variables in a dataset while
                                preserving the most important information.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It transforms the data into a new set of uncorrelated
                                features (principal components) that capture the most variance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine you have a dataset with 100 features, making it hard
                                to visualize. PCA helps reduce it to 2D or 3D while keeping the key patterns intact,
                                making it easier to analyze.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Apriori Algorithm:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It finds frequently occurring groups of items in large
                                datasets.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It follows a "bottom-up" approach, starting with
                                individual items and combining them into larger sets based on how often they appear
                                together.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> In market basket analysis, this algorithm helps stores find
                                product pairs that are often bought together, like bread and butter. This is how online
                                stores recommend "Customers who bought this also bought..." items.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It groups data points based on how densely packed they
                                are and marks outliers as noise.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Instead of assuming a fixed number of clusters, it
                                identifies high-density areas and considers points in low-density regions as noise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> It is used in fraud detection to spot unusual financial
                                transactions that do not fit into normal spending patterns.</li>
                        </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning approach where an agent learns by interacting
                        with an environment. Instead of being given direct answers, the agent takes actions and receives
                        feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</li>

                    <li>The goal is to maximize rewards over time by improving decision-making based on past
                        experiences. The agent continuously adjusts its strategy to achieve better outcomes.</li>

                    <li>Real-world applications of reinforcement learning include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teaching robots how to walk or perform tasks by learning from trial and error.</li>
                            <li>Training AI to play video games and improve its strategies through repeated gameplay.
                            </li>
                            <li>Optimizing stock trading strategies by learning from market fluctuations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>This method is highly effective for solving complex problems where the best solution is not
                        immediately obvious, making it widely used in automation, gaming, and robotics.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here are some key reinforcement learning algorithms:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Q-Learning:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It helps an agent learn the best actions to take in
                                different situations by estimating their future rewards.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It maintains a Q-table, which stores the expected reward
                                for each action in each state. The table is updated over time as the agent explores and
                                learns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A robot learning to navigate a maze. It tries different paths,
                                learns which ones lead to the goal, and eventually finds the shortest way.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Deep Q-Networks (DQN):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It improves Q-learning by using deep neural networks to
                                handle complex environments with many possible states.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Instead of storing Q-values in a table, it uses a neural
                                network to approximate them, making it more scalable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> AI playing Atari games. It watches the game screen, learns
                                which moves score the most points, and eventually masters the game.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Policy Gradient Methods:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It directly learns the best strategy (policy) for
                                choosing actions to maximize rewards.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Instead of estimating Q-values, it continuously adjusts
                                its policy using gradient ascent, improving its performance over time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Teaching a robot to walk. The algorithm refines the robot's
                                movements based on how well it balances and moves forward.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Actor-Critic Methods:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It combines two approaches—one that evaluates actions
                                (critic) and one that selects them (actor) to improve stability and efficiency.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The actor makes decisions, and the critic provides
                                feedback on whether those decisions were good or bad, helping the actor improve.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Training self-driving cars. The actor decides how to steer,
                                and the critic evaluates whether the car is following the safest route.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Monte Carlo Methods:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> It learns by completing entire sequences of actions
                                (episodes) before updating its knowledge.</li>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Instead of learning step-by-step, it waits until the end
                                of an episode and then adjusts its strategy based on the total reward received.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Learning to play board games like chess. The agent plays full
                                games, then updates its strategy based on whether it won or lost.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>In supervised learning, it's like teaching with examples. The algorithm gets both the input and the
                correct output, so it knows what the right answer is. It learns by making connections between the two,
                so it can predict the correct answer for new data. Now, in unsupervised learning, there are no correct
                answers given. The algorithm just gets the input data and has to figure out patterns or groupings all on
                its own. It’s like trying to make sense of a puzzle without knowing what the final picture looks like.
                Finally, in reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by doing. It takes actions, gets feedback in
                the form of rewards or penalties, and then adjusts to make better choices. It's like learning by trial
                and error, where it gets better the more it tries. So, while supervised learning needs both input and
                output, unsupervised learning only has input and figures things out, and reinforcement learning learns
                by interacting and improving from feedback.</p>
