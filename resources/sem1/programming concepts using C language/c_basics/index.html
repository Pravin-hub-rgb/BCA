            <h2>Design Methods</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing is the first step for obtaining solution of a given problem.</li>
                <li>The purpose of designing is to represent solution for a system.</li>
                <li>It is difficult to design a large system because the complexity of system cannot be represented
                    easily.
                <li>Thus various methods have been evolved for designing.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Top-Down Design</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top-Down design method starts from top-level component to lowest level (bottom) component.</li>
                    <li>In this design method, the system is divided into some major components.</li>
                    <li>Then each major component is divided into lower level components.</li>
                    <li>Similarly other components are divided till the lowest level component.</li>
                    <li>'C' uses top-down approach</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Bottom-Up Design</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bottom-Up design method is the reverse of Top-Down approach. It starts from the lowest level
                        component to the highest-level component.</li>
                    <li>It first designs the basic components and from these basic components the higher level component
                        is designed.</li>
                    <li>Object-oriented language such as C++ or java uses a bottom-up approach where each object is
                        indentified first.</li>

                <h3>Modular Approach</h3>
                <!-- taken from C in Depth book  -->
                <ul>
                    <li>It is better to divide a large system into modules.</li>
                    <li>In terms of programming, module is logically a well-defined part of program.</li>
                    <li>Each module is a separate part of the program.</li>
                    <li>It is easy to modify a program written with modular approach because changes in one module don't
                        affect other modules of program.</li>
                    <li>It is also easy to check bugs in the program in module level programming.</li>

            <h2>What is programming language?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming languages are the tools we use to write instructions for computers to follow.</li>
                <li>Programming languages allow us to translate the 1s and 0s into something that humans can understand
                    and write.</li>
                <li>Programming language is made up of series of symbols that serves as a bridge that allow humans to
                    translate our thoughts into instructions computers can understand.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>The programming languages can be classified into two types -
                    <br>1. Low level languages
                    <br>2. High level languages

                    <p><b>Low level languages</b></p>
                    <p>The languages in this category are the Machine level language and Assembly language.</p>
                    <div class="in">
                        <p>Machine Level Language</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Computers can understand only digits signals, which are in binary digits i.e. 0 and 1.
                            </li>
                            <li>So the instructions given to the computer can be only in binary codes.</li>
                            <li>The machine language consists of intructions that are in binary 0 or 1.</li>
                            <li>Computers can understand only machine level language.</li>
                            <li>Writing a program in machine level language is a difficult task because it is not easy
                                for
                                programmers to write instructions in binary code.</li>
                            <li>A machine level language program is error-prone and its maintenance is very difficult.
                            </li>
                            <li>Furthermore machine language programs are not portable.</li>
                            <li>Every computer has its own machine instructions, so the programs written for one
                                computer
                                are not valid for other computers.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="in">
                        <p>Assembly Language</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The difficulties faced in machine level language were reduced to some extent by using a
                                modified form of machine level language called assembly language.</li>
                            <li>In assembly language instructions are given in English like words, such as MOV, ADD, SUB
                                etc. So it is easier-to write and understand assembly programs.
                            </li>
                            <li>Since a computer can
                                understand
                                only machine level language, assembly language program must be translated into mahcine
                                language.</li>
                            <li>The translator that is used for translating is called 'assembler'.</li>
                            <li>Although writing programs in assembly language is a bit easier, the programmer has to
                                know
                                all the lower level details related with the hardware of a computer.</li>
                            <li>In assembly language, data is stored in computer registers and each computer has
                                diiferent
                                set of registers. Thus the assembly language program is also not portable.</li>
                            <li>Since the low level languages are related with the hardware, the execution of a
                                low-level
                                program is faster.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>High level languages are designed keeping in mind the features of portability i.e. these
                            languages are machine independent.</li>
                        <li>These are English like languages, so it is easy to write and understand the programs of
                            high-level language.</li>
                        <li>While programming in a high level language, the programmer is not concerned with the low
                            level details, and so the whole attention can be paid to the logic of the problem being
                            solved.</li>
                        <li>For translating a high-level language program into machine language, compiler or interpreter
                            is used.</li>
                        <li>Every language has its own compiler or interpreter.</li>

            <h2>Introduction to C Language</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>C is a general-purpose high level language that was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie for the
                    Unix operating system.</li>
                <li>It was first implemented on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 computer in 1972.</li>
                <li>The Unix operating system and virtually all Unix appications are written in the C language.</li>
                <li>C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons
                    <ul>

                        <li>It produces efficient programs</li>
                        <li>It can handle low-level activities.</li>

                <p><b>Facts about C</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</li>
                    <li>C is a successor of B languange which was introducted around 1970.</li>
                    <li>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</li>
                    <li>By 1973 UNIX OS almost totally written in C.</li>
                    <li>Today C is the most widely used System Programming Language.</li>
                    <li>Most of the state of the art software have been implemented using C</li>

                <p><b>Why to use C?</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make-up the
                        operating system.</li>
                    <li>C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast
                        as code written in assembly language.</li>
                    <li>Some example of the use of C might be :
