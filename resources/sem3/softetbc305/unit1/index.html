            <h3>Software Crisis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The term "Software Crisis" in computer science describes the difficulties faced when making useful
                    and efficient computer programs within a set time.</li>
                <li>The software crisis happened because we kept using the same workforce, methods, and tools even as
                    the need for software grew quickly. This made software more complex and challenging.</li>
                <li>As software became more complicated, many problems came up because the ways we used before weren't
                    good enough.</li>
                <li>However, if we keep using the same workforce, methods, and tools when the demand for software grows
                    fast and software becomes more complex, there can be problems. These include issues like not having
                    enough money for software, not making software efficiently, software not being very good in quality,
                    trouble managing and delivering software, and more. This situation is called a "software crisis."
