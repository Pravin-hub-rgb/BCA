                <ul>
                    <li>Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, obervations, figures,
                        symbols,
                        and descriptions of things etc.</li>
                    <li>Int other words, data does not carry specific purpose and has no significance by itself.</li>
                    <li>Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes - which are basic units of information in
                        the
                        context of computer storage and processing.</li>
                    <li>Data can be recovered and doesn't have any meaning unless processed.</li>

                <p><b>Information</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information is processed, organized and structured data.</li>
                    <li>It provides context of the data and enables decision making.</li>
                    <li>Processed data that make sense to us.</li>
                    <li>Information is extracted from the data by analyzing and interpreting pieces of data.</li>
                    <li>E.g., you have data of all the people living in your locality, its data, when you analyze and
                        interpret the data and come to some conclusion that:
                        <ol>
                            <li>There are 100 senior citizens</li>

                <p><b>Data vs information</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data is a collection of facts, while information puts those facts into context.</li>
                    <li>While data is raw and unorganized, information is organized.</li>
                    <li>Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated. Information maps out that data to provide a
                        big-picture view of how it all fits together.</li>
                    <li>Data, on its own, is meaningless. When it’s analyzed and interpreted, it becomes meaningful
                        information.</li>
                    <li>Data does not depend on information; however, information depends on data.</li>
                    <li>Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics. Information is
                        typically presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas.</li>
                    <li>Data isn’t sufficient for decision-making, but you can make decisions based on information.</li>

            <h2>What is Database?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed,
                    managed, and updated.</li>
                <li>To make real use of Data, we need Database management systems. (DBMS)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What is DBMS?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to
                    access those data. The collection of data, usually referred to as the database, contains information
                    relevant to an enterprise. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve
                    database information that is both convenient and efficient.</li>
                <li>A DBMS is the database itself, along with all the software and functionality. It is used to perform
                    different operations, like addition, access, updating, and deletion of the data.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/dbms.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>Users interact with applications through user interfaces.</li>
                <li>Applications use APIs to communicate with the DBMS.</li>
                <li>APIs provide a way for applications to send queries and commands to the DBMS.</li>
                <li>The DBMS processes these queries and commands and interacts with the database to retrieve or update
                    data.</li>
                <li>The database stores the data securely and in an organized manner.</li>
                <li>The DBMS sends the requested data or updates back to the application through the API.</li>
                <li>The application processes the data and presents it to the user through the user interface.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Database system vs File system</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Database system</b> : A Database System is a structured and organized software application that
                    manages
                    and stores collections of data. It includes a Database Management System (DBMS) along with the
                    actual databases it manages. The DBMS handles tasks such as data storage, retrieval, modification,
                    and maintenance, while providing data integrity, security, and efficient data manipulation. Database
                    systems are designed to handle large amounts of structured data and offer features like data
                    modeling, query languages, transaction management, and more.</li>
                <li><b>File system</b> : A File System is the software component of an operating system that manages the
                    storage and organization of files on storage devices. It defines the structure for storing files,
                    directories, and metadata related to each file, such as size, permissions, and location. File
                    systems provide a way for users and applications to access and manage files stored on various
                    storage media. They're generally simpler than database systems and are primarily focused on managing
                    individual files rather than structured data relationships.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Disadvantages of file system</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Data redundancy and inconsistency : </b> In file systems, the same data may be stored in
                        multiple files, leading to redundancy. This redundancy can result in inconsistencies when
                        updates are made to the same data in different files, causing discrepancies and errors.</li>
                    <li><b>Difficulty in Accessing Data : </b> Retrieving specific data from file systems can be
                        challenging. Users need to know the exact location and structure of files, leading to complex
                        code and slower data access times.</li>
                    <li><b>Data isolation : </b> In file systems, data is scattered across various files and formats,
                        making it hard to maintain consistency and integrity. Changes to data structures can lead to
                        issues in multiple places.</li>
                    <li><b>Integrity problems : </b> Maintaining data integrity (accuracy and consistency) is difficult
                        in file systems since there is no centralized control over data. Unauthorized changes and errors
                        can occur easily.</li>
                    <li><b>Atomicity problems : </b> File systems lack mechanisms to ensure atomicity, which is the
                        property that guarantees a series of operations are treated as a single, indivisible unit. If an
                        operation fails midway, there's no way to ensure the database is left in a consistent state.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Concurrent access anomalies : </b> In file systems, concurrent access to data by multiple
                        users can lead to inconsistent outcomes. Race conditions and conflicts can arise, causing
                        incorrect or unexpected results.</li>
                    <li><b>Security problems : </b> File systems have limited security features. Unauthorized access to
                        files and data can occur, leading to potential data breaches and privacy violations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The above mentioned disadvantages of file system are advantages of Database system</p>
                <h3>Advantages of Database system</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Data Redundancy and Inconsistency Resolution:</b> DBMS minimizes redundancy through
                        normalization, which eliminates data duplication. Centralized control ensures consistent
                        updates, reducing inconsistencies.</li>
                    <li><b>Efficient Data Access:</b> DBMS provides query optimization and indexing techniques, making
                        data retrieval more efficient. Users can use a common query language to access data, simplifying
                        the process.</li>
                    <li><b>Data Integration:</b> DBMS integrates data in a centralized repository, enabling data
                        isolation and easier management. Changes to data structures can be made systematically.</li>
                    <li><b>Data Integrity Enforcement:</b> DBMS enforces data integrity through constraints, triggers,
                        and validation rules. It ensures that data remains accurate and consistent.</li>
                    <li><b>Atomicity and Transaction Management:</b> DBMS ensures atomicity by using transactions. If a
                        transaction fails, the database can be rolled back to a consistent state before the transaction
                        started.</li>
                    <li><b>Concurrency Control:</b> DBMS manages concurrent access through locking mechanisms and
                        isolation levels, avoiding conflicts and maintaining data integrity.</li>
                    <li><b>Enhanced Security:</b> DBMS offers robust security features, including user authentication,
                        access control, and encryption, safeguarding data from unauthorized access.</li>
                </ul>
