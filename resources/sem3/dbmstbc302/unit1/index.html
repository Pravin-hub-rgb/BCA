                    <li>Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes - which are basic units of information in
                        the
                        context of computer storage and processing.</li>

                    <li>Data does not depend on information; however, information depends on data.</li>
                    <li>Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics. Information is
                        typically presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas.</li>

                <li>Database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed,
                    managed, and updated.</li>

            <h2>What is DBMS?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to
                    access those data. The collection of data, usually referred to as the database, contains information
                    relevant to an enterprise. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve
                    database information that is both convenient and efficient.</li>
                <li>A DBMS is the database itself, along with all the software and functionality. It is used to perform
                    different operations, like addition, access, updating, and deletion of the data.</li>
                <li>DBMS is used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, view and report etc.</li>
                <li>The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is
                    both convenient and efficient.</li>

            <div class="in">
                <p><b>DBMS is the combination of two words : DATABASE & MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A database is a collection of related information stored, so that it is available to many users
                        for different purpose.</li>
                    <li>Database management system is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain
                        the database.</li>

                <img src="../../images/dbms1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>DBMS can also be defined as an interface between the Application program and the operating
                        system to access and manipulate that database.</li>
                    <li>Database management system is a software which is used to manage the database. For example:
                        MYSQL, Oracle, etc are a very popular commercial database which is used in different
                        applications.</li>

                <li>Users interact with applications through user interfaces.</li>
                <li>Applications use APIs to communicate with the DBMS.</li>
                <li>APIs provide a way for applications to send queries and commands to the DBMS.</li>
                <li>The DBMS processes these queries and commands and interacts with the database to retrieve or update
                    data.</li>
                <li>The database stores the data securely and in an organized manner.</li>
                <li>The DBMS sends the requested data or updates back to the application through the API.</li>
                <li>The application processes the data and presents it to the user through the user interface.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Characteristics and Applications of DBMS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>It uses a digital repository established on a server to store and manage the information.</li>
                <li>It can provide a clear and logical view of the process that manipulates data.</li>
                <li>DBMS contains automatic backup and recovery procedures.</li>
                <li>It contain ACID (Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability) properties which maintain data in a
                    healthy state in case of failure.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Atomicity: This property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit
                            of work. Either all of its changes are applied to the database, or none of them are. In
                            other words, if a transaction contains multiple steps, and any step fails, the entire
                            transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged. This prevents the database
                            from being left in an inconsistent state due to partial transactions.</li>
                        <li>Consistency: Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state
                            to another. In other words, the database should follow certain rules or constraints before
                            and after the transaction. If a transaction violates any of these rules, it is not allowed
                            to be executed. This property maintains the integrity of the data and prevents data
                            corruption.</li>
                        <li>Isolation: Isolation ensures that multiple transactions can be executed concurrently without
                            interfering with each other. Each transaction is executed as if it were the only transaction
                            in the system, even if there are other transactions running at the same time. This prevents
                            issues like data being read or modified by one transaction while another transaction is
                            still in progress, which could lead to incorrect results or data corruption.</li>
                        <li> Durability: Durability guarantees that once a transaction is successfully completed and its
                            changes are committed to the database, they will persist even in the face of system failures
                            (e.g., power outage, system crash). These changes will be permanent and will not be lost.
                            This property ensures that once data is written to the database, it can be relied upon to be
                            available and consistent.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It can reduce the complex relationship between data.</li>
                <li>It is used to support maniulation and processing of data.</li>
                <li>It is used to provide security of data.</li>
                <li>It can view the database from different viewpoints according to the requirements of the user.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of DBMS</h2>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Advantages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Control database redundancy</b> &rarr; It can control data redundancy because it stores all
                        the data in one single database file and that recorded data is placed in the database.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Database redundancy refers to the situation where the same data is stored multiple times
                                in a database. Redundancy can lead to various issues, such as increased storage
                                requirements, data inconsistency (due to multiple copies of the same data being updated
                                differently), and difficulties in maintaining data accuracy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Data sharing</b> &rarr; In DBMS the authorized users of an organization can share the data
                        among multiple users.</li>
                    <li><b>Easily maintenance</b> &rarr; It can be easily maintained due to the centralized nature of
                        the database system.</li>
                    <li><b>Reduce time</b> &rarr; It reduces development time and maintenance need.</li>
                    <li><b>Backup</b> &rarr; It provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic backup of
                        data from hardware and software failure and restores the data if required.</li>
                    <li><b>Multiple user interface</b> &rarr; It provides different types of user interface like
                        graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Disadvantages of DBMS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cost of hardware and software</b> &rarr; It requires a high speed of data processor and large
                        memory size to run DBMS software.</li>
                    <li><b>Size</b> &rarr; It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Complexity</b> &rarr; Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.</li>
                    <li><b>Higher impact of failure</b> &rarr; Failure highly impacts the database because in most of
                        the organization all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to
                        electic failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.</li>

            <h2>Database system vs File system</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Database system</b> : A Database System is a structured and organized software application that
                    manages
                    and stores collections of data. It includes a Database Management System (DBMS) along with the
                    actual databases it manages. The DBMS handles tasks such as data storage, retrieval, modification,
                    and maintenance, while providing data integrity, security, and efficient data manipulation. Database
                    systems are designed to handle large amounts of structured data and offer features like data
                    modeling, query languages, transaction management, and more.</li>
                <li><b>File system</b> : A File System is the software component of an operating system that manages the
                    storage and organization of files on storage devices. It defines the structure for storing files,
                    directories, and metadata related to each file, such as size, permissions, and location. File
                    systems provide a way for users and applications to access and manage files stored on various
                    storage media. They're generally simpler than database systems and are primarily focused on managing
                    individual files rather than structured data relationships.</li>

                        challenging. Users need to know the exact location and structure of files, leading to complex
                        code and slower data access times.</li>
                    <li><b>Data isolation : </b> In file systems, data is scattered across various files and formats,
                        making it hard to maintain consistency and integrity. Changes to data structures can lead to
                        issues in multiple places.</li>
                    <li><b>Integrity problems : </b> Maintaining data integrity (accuracy and consistency) is difficult
                        in file systems since there is no centralized control over data. Unauthorized changes and errors
                        can occur easily.</li>
                    <li><b>Atomicity problems : </b> File systems lack mechanisms to ensure atomicity, which is the
                        property that guarantees a series of operations are treated as a single, indivisible unit. If an
                        operation fails midway, there's no way to ensure the database is left in a consistent state.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Concurrent access anomalies : </b> In file systems, concurrent access to data by multiple
                        users can lead to inconsistent outcomes. Race conditions and conflicts can arise, causing
                        incorrect or unexpected results.</li>
                    <li><b>Security problems : </b> File systems have limited security features. Unauthorized access to
                        files and data can occur, leading to potential data breaches and privacy violations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The above mentioned disadvantages of file system are advantages of Database system</p>
                <h3>Advantages of Database system</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Data Redundancy and Inconsistency Resolution:</b> DBMS minimizes redundancy through
                        normalization, which eliminates data duplication. Centralized control ensures consistent
                        updates, reducing inconsistencies.</li>
                    <li><b>Efficient Data Access:</b> DBMS provides query optimization and indexing techniques, making
                        data retrieval more efficient. Users can use a common query language to access data, simplifying
                        the process.</li>
                    <li><b>Data Integration:</b> DBMS integrates data in a centralized repository, enabling data
                        isolation and easier management. Changes to data structures can be made systematically.</li>
                    <li><b>Data Integrity Enforcement:</b> DBMS enforces data integrity through constraints, triggers,
                        and validation rules. It ensures that data remains accurate and consistent.</li>
                    <li><b>Atomicity and Transaction Management:</b> DBMS ensures atomicity by using transactions. If a
                        transaction fails, the database can be rolled back to a consistent state before the transaction
                        started.</li>
                    <li><b>Concurrency Control:</b> DBMS manages concurrent access through locking mechanisms and
                        isolation levels, avoiding conflicts and maintaining data integrity.</li>
                    <li><b>Enhanced Security:</b> DBMS offers robust security features, including user authentication,
                        access control, and encryption, safeguarding data from unauthorized access.</li>
