        <h1>Introduction to SQL</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>SQL stands for "Structured Query Language," a domain-specific language used for managing relational
                databases.</li>
            <li>It provides a standardized way to interact with databases by using English-like commands.</li>
            <li>SQL commands include querying to retrieve data, inserting new records, updating existing data, and
                deleting data.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>SQL Basics</h2>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Nonprocedural Nature</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL is a nonprocedural language, meaning users specify what data to retrieve, not how to
                        retrieve
                        it.
                    </li>
                    <li>Users describe the desired result, and the underlying Database Management System (DBMS) handles
                        the
                        retrieval process.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>SQL Usage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL itself does not function as a standalone database management system (DBMS).</li>
                    <li>It acts as a medium for communication between users and the DBMS.</li>
                    <li>SQL is utilized in two primary ways: Interactive SQL and Programmatic SQL.</li>
                    <li>Interactive SQL involves typing SQL commands directly into a command line interface, with
                        immediate
                        execution and results display.</li>
                    <li>Programmatic SQL involves embedding SQL statements within host languages like COBOL, FORTRAN, or
                        C.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Features of SQL</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL serves as a powerful data access language that allows users to manipulate and manage
                        database
                        content.</li>
                    <li>It's based on relational tuple calculus, which provides a foundation for working with structured
                        data.
                    </li>
                    <li>SQL is considered a standard relational database management language used across various
                        database
                        systems.</li>
                    <li>The first commercial DBMS to support SQL was Oracle in 1979, marking a significant milestone in
                        database
                        technology.</li>
                    <li>SQL's nonprocedural or declarative nature emphasizes describing what you want, leaving the
                        details
                        to
                        the DBMS.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Choose a Database Management System (DBMS):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A DBMS is software that helps you manage databases. There are various options available, such as
                        MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database. Choose the one that best
                        fits your needs.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Install the DBMS:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Download and install the chosen DBMS on your computer or server. Follow the installation
                        instructions provided by the DBMS.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Access the DBMS:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Depending on the DBMS, you might access it through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical
                        user interface (GUI). For example, MySQL can be accessed through the MySQL Command Line Client
                        or various GUI tools like phpMyAdmin.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>MySQL</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm choosing MySQL as my preferred Database Management System (DBMS).</li>
                <li>MySQL is a popular and robust
                    open-source relational DBMS that provides powerful tools for managing and manipulating structured
                    data.</li>
                <li>With MySQL, I'll be able to create and maintain databases, store data in organized tables,
                    perform efficient data queries, and manage data relationships. Its versatility and widespread
                    adoption make it an excellent choice for a wide range of applications, from small projects to
                    large-scale systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>SQL vs MySQL</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used for managing and querying databases. It
                        serves as a medium for communication between users and various Database Management Systems
                        (DBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more. MySQL, on the other hand, is a specific
                        implementation of a DBMS that uses SQL as its query language. It's important to differentiate
                        between the language (SQL) and the specific system (MySQL) when discussing database-related
                        topics.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Inside MySQL shell or GUI, we are going to start using commands.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Create a Database</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once you're in the MySQL command-line interface, you can create a new database using the CREATE
                        DATABASE command. Replace mydatabase with the name you want to give to your database:</li>
                </ul>
                <pre>
                    <code>
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>Following command shows all the existing databases in your system &darr;</li>
                </ul>
                <pre>
                    <code>
SHOW DATABASES;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use "IF NOT EXIST" clause or condition while creating your database as this is used to
                        create a new database with the specified name (db-name) if it doesn't already exist. This
                        statement is commonly used to ensure that a database is created only if it hasn't been created
                        before, preventing any potential errors or conflicts that might arise from attempting to create
                        a database that already exists. &darr;</li>
                </ul>
                <pre>
                    <code>
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db-name;
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Use the Database</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>After creating the database, you need to switch to it to perform operations within it. Use the
                        USE command:</li>
                </ul>
                <pre>
                    <code>
USE mydatabase;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>From here we will learn all the other operations like create table,...</li>
