            <h2>Register Transfer Language (RTL)</h2>
            <p><b>What is register?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Register is a very fast computer memory, used to store data/instruction in-execution.
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Register is a group of flip-flops with each flip-flop capable of storing one bit of
                            information.</li>
                        <li>An <b>n-bit register</b> has a group of n flip-flops and is capable of storing binary
                            information of n-bits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Hence, a register consists of a group of flip-flops and gates.</li>
                <li>Use of flip flop: Flip flop holds the binary information and gates control when when and how new
                    information is transferred into a register.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Before learning Register Transfer Language we should know what are registers and why we are learning
                    them? What is its significane in digital machine?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We know that digital machine work with digital circuits.</li>
                <li>There are two types of digital circuits:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combinational circuits</li>
                        <li>Sequential circuits</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>We came accross flip flop in digital circuits and we know that a register is a group of flip-flop
                    which can store bit of information.</li>
                <li>Simple digital systems are frequently characterized in terms of:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The register they contain.
                            <ul>
                                <li>When we say our computer if of 64 bit, we mean that the size of register which we is
                                    used to pass instruction to the machine is of size 64 bits.</li>
                                <li>The resistor can store larger amounts of data.</li>
                                <li>Instructions and data can be processed more efficiently.</li>
                                <li>That's why we are learning about registers.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The operations that are performed on data stored in them.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The operations executed on the data in registers are called micro-operations e.g. shit, count, clear
                    and load.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Some of the commonly used register are:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accumulator</b> : This is the most common register, used to store data taken out from the memory.

                <li><b>General Purpose Registers</b> : This is used to store data intermediate results during program
                    execution. It can be accessed via assembly programming.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Special purpose registers:</b> Users do not access these registers. These registers are for computer
                system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>MAR</b> : Memory Address Register are those registers that holds the address for memory unit.
                </li>
                <li><b>MBR</b> : Memory Buffer Register stores instruction and data received from the memory and sent
                    from the memory.</li>
                <li><b>PC</b> : Program Counter points to the next instruction to be executed.</li>
                <li><b>IR</b> : Instruction Register holds the instruction to be executed.</li>

                    <li>We know CPU reads and write data on memory. So this address register is used to store memory
                        address of
                        data for CPU.</li>
                    <li>It picks data from memory like addresses, addresses stored in address register, AR gives the
                        addres to memory, memory then decodes the addresses and then fetches the data from RAM.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Memory Data Register (MDR) is a component of a computer's CPU that temporarily holds data
                        fetched from or destined for the computer's memory. When the CPU reads data from memory, it's
                        stored in the MDR before being processed. Similarly, when the CPU writes data to memory, it
                        places the data in the MDR before sending it to the memory. The MDR essentially acts as a
                        temporary storage location for data during memory read and write operations.</li>

                    <li>The Memory Buffer Register (MBR) is used in input/output (I/O) operations in computer systems.
                        It holds data that is being transferred between the CPU and an I/O device, such as a hard drive
                        or network interface. The MBR helps in coordinating data transfers between the CPU and I/O
                        devices, ensuring efficient communication and minimizing bottlenecks. It serves as a temporary
                        buffer to hold data that is moving between the CPU and external devices.</li>

                    <li>It is also called Processor Register.</li>
                    <li>The accumulator register retrieves data from memory and temporarily stores it before
                        transferring it to the ALU. This intermediate step allows data to be efficiently accessed by the
                        ALU for various arithmetic and logical operations. By doing so, the processor optimizes
                        performance by minimizing direct memory access during calculations.</li>

            <h2>Bus and memory transfer</h2>
            <p><b>Q-</b> Why there is a need to have a bus.
            <ul>
                <li>In a digital system with multiple registers, it's not feasible to create direct connections for data
                    and control lines between each pair of registers to allow them to directly load content from any
                    other register. This is why computer systems use a busâ€”a shared communication pathwayâ€”allowing
                    efficient data transfer among various components.</li>
                <li>A bus structure consists of set of common lines, one for each bit of a register through which binary
                    information is transfered one at a time. It have a control circuits to select which register is the
                    source, and which is the destination.</li>
                <li>This is how we are designing the bus systems from register to bus. Bus &larr; R

            <ul>
                <li>Bus Transfer is the most efficient way to transfer data. The transfer of data from the Bus lines to
                    the outside environment and vice versa is known as Bus transfer. Similarly, the transfer of data
                    from the memory unit to the outside environment and vice versa is known as memory transfer.</li>

                    <li>A three state gate is a digital circuit that exhibits tree states in which two fo the states are
                        signals equivalent to logic 0 and 1 as in a conventional gate, the third gate is the high
                        impedance state (which will restrict the flow of input towards the output).</li>
                    <li>The high impedence state behaves like an open circuit, which means that output is disconnected
                        and does not have logic significance.</li>
                    <li>A three state bus buffer has a control input that determines the output state. When the control
                        input is equal to 1, the output is enabled and the gate behaves like a conventional buffer with
                        the output equal to the normal input. When the control input is 0 the output is disabled and the
                        date goes to high impedence state, regardless of the value in the normal input.</li>

                    corresponding 1 in B. It does not affect bit positions that have 0â€™s in B. For example: </P>
                <img src="../../images/selectiveset2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>Again the two leftmost bits of B are 1â€™s, so the corresponding bits of A are complemented. The
                        exclusive-OR microoperation can be used to selectively complement. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Selective-clear</b>: The selective clear operatons clears to 0 the bits in A only where there are
                    corresponding 1 in B. For example &darr;</p>
                <img src="../../images/selectiveset3.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>Again the two leftmost bits of B are 1â€™s, so the corresponding bits of A are cleared to 0. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Mask operation</b>: The mask operation is similar to the selective-clear operation except that the
                    bits of A are cleared only where there are corresponding 0â€™s in B. The mask operation is an AND
                    micro operation as seen from the following numerical example:</p>
                <img src="../../images/mask1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>The two rightmost bits of A are cleared because the corresponding bits of B are 0â€™s. The two
                        leftmost bits are left unchanged because the corresponding bits of B are 1â€™s. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Insertion operation</b>: The insert operation inserts a new value into a group of bits. This is
                    done by first masking the bits and then ORing them with the required value. For example, suppose
                    that an A register contains eight bits, 0110 1010. To replace the four leftmost bits by the value
                    1001 we first mask the four unwanted bits: </p>

                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p><b>Clear operation</b>: The clear operation compares the words in A and B and produces an all 0â€™s
                    result if the two numbers are equal. This operation is achieved by an exclusive-OR microoperation as
                    shown by the following example: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>When A and B are equal, the two corresponding bits are either both 0 or both 1. In either case
                        the exclusive-OR operation produces a 0. The all-0â€™s result is then checked to determine if the
                        two numbers were equal</li>

                <h3>Shift mirco-operations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shift microoperations are used for serial transfer of data. The contents of a register can be
                        shifted to the left or the right. There are three types of shifts: logical, circular and
                        arithmetic.</li>
                    <li><b>A logical shift</b> is one that transfers 0 through the serial input. They symbols <b>shl</b>
                        and
                        <b>shr</b> are used to show logical shift-left and shift-right microoperations. For example
                        &darr;
                    </li>
                    <img src="../../images/shl.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                    <li><b>The circular shift</b> (also known as a rotate operation) circulates the bits of the register
                        around the two ends without loss of information. This is accomplished by connecting the serial
                        output of the shift register to its serial input. We will use the symbols <b>cil</b> and
                        <b>cir</b> for the circular shift left and right, respectively.
                    </li>
                    <img src="../../images/circularshift.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                    <li><b>An arithmetic shift</b>, shifts a signed binary number to the left or right. An arithmetic
                        shift-left multiplies a signed binary number by 2. An arithmetic shift-right divides the number
                        by 2. Arithmetic shifts must leave the sign bit unchanged because the sign of the number remains
                        the same when it is multiplied or divided by 2.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The arithmetic shift-right leaves the sign bit unchanged and shifts the number to the
                                right. Thus Rn-1 remains the same, Rn -2 receives the bit from Rn -1. The bit in R0 is
                                lost. The arithmetic shift-left inserts a 0 into R0, and shifts all other bits to the
                                left. The initial bit of Rn-1 is lost and replaced by the bit from Rn-2. </li>

                <p>Using these basic 3 modules a computer is build.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We have learned about the operations that are performed by ALU (Arithmetic Logical Unit) module
                        of processor like
                        shift operation, arithmetic, logic, etc.</li>
                    <li>ALU basically perform operation when data and instructions(add, sub) are given to it and then it
                        generates result.</li>
                    <li>The ALU by itself can't finish the job, as it needs the right instructions for calculating
                        results in a specific time. This is why another part inside the processor, called the control
                        unit, is necessary. The control unit makes sure the timing and control signals are all set.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Why CU is important?</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Control Unit (CU) plays a vital role in the computer's operation.</li>
                    <li>When data arrives for processing, it can't directly enter the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) as the
                        ALU doesn't have the ability to understand what to do with the data without instructions.</li>
                    <li>This is how it functions: Initially, the data is stored in registers, which act as temporary
                        holding areas. Following that, the Control Unit (CU) becomes active.</li>
                    <li>The Control Unit generates instructions that guide the ALU's actions:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Retrieving data from the registers</li>
                        <li>Activating specific circuits within the ALU for precise time intervals, facilitating
                            calculations</li>
                        <li>Providing the final calculated result once the computations are finished.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Basically CU is that module of a processor which controls all the operations happening inside
                        the processor.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Exploring the core components of a computer highlights a vital fact: INSTRUCTIONS are the backbone

                    <li><b>Definition &rarr; </b> It is a mechanism by which modules like I/O or memory may interrupt
                        the normal processing of CPU.</li>
                    <li>Interrupt is required to improve the processing efficiency of CPU.</li>
                    <li>How does it happen?
                        <ul>
                            <li>CPUs are designed to execute instructions at a very high speed, often measured in
                                gigahertz (GHz), which means they can perform a large number of operations per second.
                                On the other hand, many external devices, such as keyboards, hard drives, or network
                                interfaces, operate at significantly slower speeds. For instance, hard drives might
                                transfer data at rates of megabytes per second, which is much slower compared to the
                                billions of instructions the CPU can execute in the same amount of time.</li>
                            <li>Without Interrupts: Imagine a scenario where the CPU is executing a program and needs to
                                read data from a slow external device. If interrupts were not used, the CPU would need
                                to continuously poll (check) the external device to see if it has data ready for
                                processing. This polling would involve the CPU repeatedly asking the device, "Are you
                                ready yet?" and waiting for a response.</li>
                            <li>Wasted CPU Time: During this waiting period, the CPU would not be doing anything
                                productive. It would spend a significant portion of its time repeatedly checking the
                                device's status instead of executing useful instructions from the program it's supposed
                                to run. This results in a wastage of CPU processing power and efficiency.</li>
                            <li>Interrupt Solution: Here's where interrupts come into play. When an external device has
                                data ready for processing or an event occurs that requires CPU attention, the device
                                sends an interrupt signal to the CPU. The CPU then temporarily suspends its current
                                activities, saves its current state, and switches to the appropriate interrupt handler
                                routine to deal with the event.

                                This allows the CPU to efficiently manage its time. It doesn't need to constantly poll
                                devices. Instead, it can continue executing other tasks or programs until an interrupt
                                occurs. When an interrupt happens, the CPU switches to handling that interrupt,
                                processes the required data or event, and then resumes its previous activities.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>In essence, interrupts allow the CPU to be more productive by not wasting time waiting for
                        slower devices. Instead, it can work on multiple tasks in parallel, efficiently responding to
                        external events and data availability as needed.</li>

                <p><b>Method 1 : Disable multiple interrupts</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>is a technique used in interrupt handling to temporarily prevent the CPU from responding to
                        additional interrupts while it is already processing an interrupt. This approach ensures that
                        the CPU completes the current interrupt handling routine without being interrupted by other
                        interrupt requests. Once the current interrupt is fully handled, the CPU re-enables interrupts,
                        allowing it to respond to new interrupt requests.</li>

                    <li><b>Advantages : </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Predictable Handling: Disabling multiple interrupts ensures that the CPU completes the
                                current interrupt handling routine without being interrupted by other interrupts. This
                                can lead to more predictable and deterministic behavior in critical tasks.</li>
                            <li>Simplicity: This approach can simplify the interrupt handling process, making it easier
                                to manage and debug interrupt-related code.</li>
                            <li>Avoids Race Conditions: By preventing multiple interrupts from occurring simultaneously,
                                the CPU avoids potential race conditions where multiple interrupts might interact in
                                unexpected ways.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Disadvantages : </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Interrupt Latency: While the CPU is handling an interrupt with interrupts disabled, it
                                cannot respond to other interrupts, potentially causing a delay in handling
                                time-sensitive events.</li>
                            <li>Unresponsiveness: If an interrupt with high priority occurs while interrupts are
                                disabled, the system might not be able to promptly respond, leading to reduced system
                                responsiveness.</li>
                            <li>Interrupt Priority: Disabling multiple interrupts can prevent lower-priority interrupts
                                from being serviced during the execution of a higher-priority interrupt, potentially
                                affecting the overall system performance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Method 2 : Give priority to interrupt</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "give priority to interrupt" technique is an interrupt handling strategy in computer systems
                        where different interrupts are assigned different priority levels. When multiple interrupts
                        occur simultaneously or in quick succession, the system responds to the interrupt with the
                        highest priority first. This approach ensures that critical or time-sensitive events are
                        addressed promptly, even if other interrupts are pending.</li>
