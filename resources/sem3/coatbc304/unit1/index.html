            <h2>Register Transfer Language (RTL)</h2>
            <p><b>What is register?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Register is a very fast computer memory, used to store data/instruction in-execution.
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Register is a group of flip-flops with each flip-flop capable of storing one bit of
                            information.</li>
                        <li>An <b>n-bit register</b> has a group of n flip-flops and is capable of storing binary
                            information of n-bits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Hence, a register consists of a group of flip-flops and gates.</li>
                <li>Use of flip flop: Flip flop holds the binary information and gates control when when and how new
                    information is transferred into a register.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Before learning Register Transfer Language we should know what are registers and why we are learning
                    them? What is its significane in digital machine?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We know that digital machine work with digital circuits.</li>
                <li>There are two types of digital circuits:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combinational circuits</li>
                        <li>Sequential circuits</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>We came accross flip flop in digital circuits and we know that a register is a group of flip-flop
                    which can store bit of information.</li>
                <li>Simple digital systems are frequently characterized in terms of:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The register they contain.
                            <ul>
                                <li>When we say our computer if of 64 bit, we mean that the size of register which we is
                                    used to pass instruction to the machine is of size 64 bits.</li>
                                <li>The resistor can store larger amounts of data.</li>
                                <li>Instructions and data can be processed more efficiently.</li>
                                <li>That's why we are learning about registers.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The operations that are performed on data stored in them.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The operations executed on the data in registers are called micro-operations e.g. shit, count, clear
                    and load.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Some of the commonly used register are:</b></p>

                    execution. It can be accessed via assembly programming.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Special purpose registers:</b> Users do not access these registers. These registers are for computer
                system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>MAR</b> : Memory Address Register are those registers that holds the address for memory unit.
                </li>
                <li><b>MBR</b> : Memory Buffer Register stores instruction and data received from the memory and sent
                    from the memory.</li>
                <li><b>PC</b> : Program Counter points to the next instruction to be executed.</li>
                <li><b>IR</b> : Instruction Register holds the instruction to be executed.</li>

                    <li>We know CPU reads and write data on memory. So this address register is used to store memory
                        address of
                        data for CPU.</li>
                    <li>It picks data from memory like addresses, addresses stored in address register, AR gives the
                        addres to memory, memory then decodes the addresses and then fetches the data from RAM.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Memory Data Register (MDR) is a component of a computer's CPU that temporarily holds data
                        fetched from or destined for the computer's memory. When the CPU reads data from memory, it's
                        stored in the MDR before being processed. Similarly, when the CPU writes data to memory, it
                        places the data in the MDR before sending it to the memory. The MDR essentially acts as a
                        temporary storage location for data during memory read and write operations.</li>

                    <li>The Memory Buffer Register (MBR) is used in input/output (I/O) operations in computer systems.
                        It holds data that is being transferred between the CPU and an I/O device, such as a hard drive
                        or network interface. The MBR helps in coordinating data transfers between the CPU and I/O
                        devices, ensuring efficient communication and minimizing bottlenecks. It serves as a temporary
                        buffer to hold data that is moving between the CPU and external devices.</li>

                    <li>It is also called Processor Register.</li>
                    <li>The accumulator register retrieves data from memory and temporarily stores it before
                        transferring it to the ALU. This intermediate step allows data to be efficiently accessed by the
                        ALU for various arithmetic and logical operations. By doing so, the processor optimizes
                        performance by minimizing direct memory access during calculations.</li>

            <h2>Register Transfer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Register Transfer refers to the movement of data between registers within a computer's central
                    processing unit (CPU) as part of executing instructions. It involves the controlled transfer of
                    binary data from one register to another, often through arithmetic or logic operations, forming
                    the fundamental basis for instruction execution and data manipulation in a computer's
                    microarchitecture.</li>
                <li>Basically it is copying contents of one register to another.</li>
                <li>A register transfer is indicated as &darr;<br>

                        <li>In this case the contents of register R1 are copied (loaded into) register R2.</li>
                        <li>A simultaneous transfer of all bit from the source R1 to the destination register R2, during
                            one clock pulse.</li>
                        <li>Note that this is non-destructive, i.e. the contents of R1 are not altered by copying
                            (loading) them to R2.</li>
                        <li>The data is tranfered parallely.</li>

            <h2>Bus and memory transfer</h2>
            <p><b>Q-</b> Why there is a need to have a bus.
            <ul>
                <li>In a digital system with multiple registers, it's not feasible to create direct connections for data
                    and control lines between each pair of registers to allow them to directly load content from any
                    other register. This is why computer systems use a busâ€”a shared communication pathwayâ€”allowing
                    efficient data transfer among various components.</li>
                <li>A bus structure consists of set of common lines, one for each bit of a register through which binary
                    information is transfered one at a time. It have a control circuits to select which register is the
                    source, and which is the destination.</li>
                <li>This is how we are designing the bus systems from register to bus. Bus &larr; R

            <ul>
                <li>Bus Transfer is the most efficient way to transfer data. The transfer of data from the Bus lines to
                    the outside environment and vice versa is known as Bus transfer. Similarly, the transfer of data
                    from the memory unit to the outside environment and vice versa is known as memory transfer.</li>

                    Thus a 16-bit word contains two bytes, and a 32-bit word is made up of four bytes. </li>
