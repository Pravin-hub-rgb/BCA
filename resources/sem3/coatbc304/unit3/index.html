                <h3>Single Accumulator Organization</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We are familiar with the general format of a register, which is utilized for storing and
                        manipulating data. A register typically consists of a mode, opcode, and operand.
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Mode:</strong> Specifies the address mode.</li>
                            <li><strong>Opcode:</strong> Indicates the operation to be performed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data:</strong> Contains the actual data.</li>
                        </ol>
                        This type of register is employed in computer architectures.
                    </li>
                    <li>Now, let's delve into the Single Accumulator Organization: Basic computers often adopt the
                        single accumulator organization, where the accumulator serves as a dedicated register.</li>
                    <li>Operations are executed within the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which resides inside the Central
                        Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU is directly linked to the register, ensuring high-speed data
                        transfer.</li>
                    <li>The input data for the ALU is sourced from the accumulator register, and the result of the ALU
                        calculation is then stored back in the accumulator.</li>
                    <li>Single Accumulator Organization is chosen when cost-effectiveness is a priority. By minimizing
                        the number of registers, we reduce the overall system cost.</li>
                    <li>Registers are the fastest form of memory, and connecting them directly to the CPU ensures rapid
                        data exchange, contributing to high system performance. The more registers used, the higher the
                        cost. To achieve cost-effectiveness, a single accumulator register is employed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Definition of Single Accumulator Organization:</strong> In this architecture, a single
                        accumulator register is designated for arithmetic and logic operations. It optimizes cost by
                        limiting the number of registers, emphasizing efficiency in simple computing systems.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>General Architecture of Single Accumulator Organization</strong></p>
                <img src="../../images/singleacreg1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>In this architecture, we have a Program Counter (PC) responsible for storing addresses, and it
                        is connected to the memory. Additionally, there is an Accumulator (AC) connected to the
                        Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).</li>
                    <li>The data stored in memory is retrieved and transferred to the Instruction Register (IR), from
                        where it is moved to the Accumulator (AC) and subsequently processed in the Arithmetic Logic
                        Unit (ALU).</li>
                    <li>The ALU and memory components are interconnected through a common bus, facilitating the exchange
                        of data between them.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>This type of organization supports single-address instructions. As an example, consider the
                        instruction sequence for the operation C = A + B:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LDA A:</strong> Load the content of memory location A into the Accumulator (AC).</li>
                    <li><strong>ADD B:</strong> Add the content of memory location B to the data in the Accumulator
                        (AC).</li>
                    <li><strong>Store C:</strong> Store the result in the Accumulator (AC) back to the memory location
                        designated for C.</li>
                </ul>
