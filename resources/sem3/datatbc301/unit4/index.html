                <h3>Repeater</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A repeater operates at the Physical layer of the networking model.</li>
                    <li>Its primary function is to receive incoming signals, and subsequently, re-transmit these signals
                        to extend their reach over longer distances. Essentially, repeaters help overcome the
                        limitations of signal attenuation during transmission.</li>
                    <li>Contrary to common belief, repeaters do not amplify the signal. Instead, when the signal
                        weakens, repeaters replicate the signal's data bit by bit and then regenerate it back to its
                        original strength. This process ensures that the signal remains intelligible and usable despite
                        the distance it travels.</li>
                    <li>Structurally, repeaters are designed with two ports: one for signal input and another for signal
                        output. This allows them to intercept incoming signals, reinvigorate them, and then forward them
                        to the next segment of the network.</li>
                    <li>Limitations: While repeaters are effective at combating signal degradation, they are not a
                        universal solution. They cannot address issues like latency, noise, or errors introduced during
                        transmission. For these challenges, other networking components like routers, switches, and
                        error correction mechanisms come into play.</li>
                    <li>Chain of Repeaters: In scenarios where very long distances need to be covered, a chain of
                        repeaters can be used. Each repeater in the chain restores and retransmits the signal, further
                        extending its reach.</li>
                    <li>Application: Repeaters find use in various communication mediums, including wired and wireless
                        networks. For example, they are employed in Ethernet networks to counteract signal degradation
                        over lengthy cable runs.</li>

                <h3>Hub</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A hub functions as a multi-port networking device, similar to a multiport repeater, due to its
                        ability to regenerate and distribute signals to multiple connected devices.</li>
                    <li>Operating primarily at the Physical layer of networking, a hub's primary role is to facilitate
                        connections among computers within a Local Area Network (LAN), allowing them to communicate and
                        share resources.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hubs are of three types:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Active hub: Equipped with its own power supply, the active hub not only rejuvenates weak signals
                        but also amplifies and reinforces them across the network. Essentially functioning as both a
                        repeater and a central point for connecting cables, the active hub enhances signal quality and
                        serves as a distribution hub.</li>
                    <li>Passive hub: This hub serves as a collection point for network nodes' wiring while drawing its
                        power supply from an active hub. It does not possess signal amplification capabilities but
                        rather facilitates the physical interconnection of devices within the network.</li>
                    <li>Intelligent hub: Operating in a manner similar to an active hub, the intelligent hub offers the
                        additional feature of remote management capabilities. This enables network administrators to
                        monitor and manage the hub's performance, connections, and potentially connected devices from a
                        central location.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Bridge</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Operating at the Data Link layer of the networking model, a bridge is a device that combines the
                        functionalities of a repeater with the ability to intelligently filter content based on the
                        source and destination MAC addresses.</li>
                    <li>Bridges serve as a means of interconnecting two separate Local Area Networks (LANs) that operate
                        on the same network protocol, extending network connectivity.</li>
                    <li>Unlike hubs, which indiscriminately broadcast data to all connected devices, bridges implement a
                        level of intelligence by selectively transmitting data only to the devices that require it. This
                        filtering is achieved by examining the MAC addresses of both the source and destination devices
                        in the data frame.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/bridgedevice.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>Filtering Mechanism: A bridge maintains a table known as a MAC address table or bridge table.
                        This table records the MAC addresses of devices connected to each of its ports. When a data
                        frame arrives, the bridge checks the destination MAC address against the entries in its table
                        and forwards the frame only to the port associated with the destination device, reducing
                        unnecessary network traffic and improving efficiency.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Switch</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Functioning at the Data Link layer of the networking model, a switch is a multiport networking
                        device that builds upon the foundation of a bridge. It combines intelligent content filtering
                        with enhanced efficiency and performance features.</li>
                    <li>Similar to a multiport bridge, a switch includes additional capabilities, such as buffering and
                        specialized design considerations, that contribute to its improved performance compared to
                        traditional bridges.</li>
                    <li>One of the key differentiators between a switch and a bridge lies in the number of available
                        ports. While bridges typically have only two ports, switches are designed with multiple ports,
                        enabling numerous devices to simultaneously establish connections and communicate.</li>
                    <li>Unlike older networking setups where bridges could transmit data only between two devices at a
                        time, switches can concurrently process data from multiple devices, reducing latency and
                        enhancing overall network throughput.</li>
                    <li>Similar to bridges, switches also employ MAC address tables to learn the association between MAC
                        addresses and the corresponding switch ports. As devices transmit data, the switch populates its
                        table to optimize data forwarding.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Router</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A router is a device similar to a switch, but it operates by directing data packets based on
                        their IP addresses.</li>
                    <li>Its primary role falls within the network layer of networking.</li>
                    <li>While a switch excels at connecting devices within a network, a router has the unique ability to
                        connect different networks together, including LANs and WANs.</li>
                    <li>One distinctive feature of routers is their dynamically updated routing table. This table acts
                        as a map that guides routers in deciding where to send data. It holds vital information,
                        including various IP addresses.</li>
                    <li>Routers are like postal workers for the internet. They look at IP addresses on data packets and
                        decide how to best deliver them, ensuring data reaches its intended destination.</li>
                    <li> Routers play a critical role in managing internet traffic. They determine the fastest and most
                        efficient paths for data to travel across the complex web of networks that make up the internet.
                    </li>

                <h3>Gateway</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A gateway is a network node that links two separate networks using different protocols.</li>
                    <li>It functions as a "gate" that connects and enables communication between these distinct
                        networks.</li>
                    <li>A gateway can take various forms, such as a router, firewall, server, or other devices. Its role
                        is to allow traffic to smoothly enter and exit a network.</li>
                    <li>One of the key roles of a gateway is to translate data between different network protocols. This
                        is crucial when connecting networks that use different rules for communication.</li>
                    <li> A gateway acts as a mediator, helping networks with different communication methods understand
                        and exchange information.</li>
                    <li>In the conNetwork Layer of the internet, a gateway often refers to a device that connects a
                        local network
                        to the broader internet, managing data flow and security.</li>
