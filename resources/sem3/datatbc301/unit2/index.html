            <li>The Physical Layer is the foundational layer in the OSI model of networking, responsible for
                transmitting data as electromagnetic signals across various transmission media. </li>
            <li>Understanding the core principles of data, signals, and functions within this layer is crucial for
                comprehending how information is moved within a network. Let's explore this in a structured manner:</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Physical Layer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Physical Layer forms the basis for all higher-level network functions. It deals with the actual
                    transmission of data over various mediums like copper cables, optical fibers, or wireless channels.
                </li>
                <li>To fully grasp the significance of data, signals, and the functions in this layer, consider the
                    following:</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Functions and Services of the Physical Layer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Signal Encoding and Decoding: The physical layer is responsible for encoding digital data into
                        analog signals for transmission and decoding received analog signals back into digital data.
                    </li>
                    <li>Transmission Medium Management: It manages the interaction between data and the transmission
                        medium, ensuring that data is appropriately prepared for transmission over different types of
                        media.</li>
                    <li>Signal Multiplexing: The Physical Layer supports techniques like multiplexing, allowing multiple
                        signals to share the same transmission medium without interference.</li>
                    <li>Error Detection and Correction: Often, the physical layer includes error detection and
                        correction mechanisms to ensure data integrity during transmission.</li>

                <h3>Data and Signals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the major functions of the physical layer is to move data in the form of electromagnetic
                        signals across a transmission medium.</li>
                    <li>Whether you are collecting numerical statistics from another computer, sending animated pictures
                        from a design workstation, or causing a bell to ring at a distant control center, you are
                        working with the transmission of data across network connections.</li>
                    <li>Generally, the data usable to a person or application are not in a form that can be transmitted
                        over a network. For example, a photograph must first be changed to a form that transmission
                        media can accept.</li>
                    <li>Transmission media work by conducting energy along a physical path.</li>
                    <li>To be transmitted, data must be transformed into electromagnetic signals.</li>

                <h3>Signals and Their Characteristics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Signals in the context of the physical layer are representations of data in the form of
                        electromagnetic waves.</li>
                    <li>These signals can vary in characteristics, including amplitude, frequency, and phase, depending
                        on the modulation technique used.</li>
                    <li>Understanding signal characteristics is essential for efficient data transmission and reception,
                        as different types of signals are suited for different transmission mediums and distances.</li>

            <h2>Digital and Analog</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In the world of data and signals, there are two fundamental categories that we encounter: analog and
                    digital.</li>
                <li>These terms define how information is represented and transmitted, whether it's the data itself or
                    the signals that carry it. </li>
                <li>Understanding the distinction between analog and digital is crucial in the field of information
                    technology and telecommunications.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Analog and Digital Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data, the raw information we work with, can be categorized as either analog or digital. The key
                        distinction lies in the nature of the information's presentation.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Analog Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analog data is characterized by its continuity; it represents information as a continuous flow.
                    </li>
                    <li>Consider an analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands. The movement of these hands
                        provides information in a continuous form, where time progresses smoothly.</li>
                    <li>Similarly, analog data can be found in the sounds produced by a human voice. When someone
                        speaks, an analog wave is created in the air, representing continuous values.</li>
                    <li>This analog data can be captured by a microphone and converted into either an analog or digital
                        signal.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Digital Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In contrast, digital data is discrete in nature, representing information through distinct and
                        separate states.</li>
                    <li>Think of digital data as the numbers 0 and 1. These binary digits (bits) are the building blocks
                        of digital information.</li>
                    <li>Computers, for example, store and manipulate data using combinations of 0s and 1s.</li>
                    <li>The transition from 8:05 to 8:06 on a digital clock perfectly illustrates the discrete nature of
                        digital data.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Analog and Digital Signals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Just as data can be analog or digital, the signals used to transmit this data can also be
                        categorized into analog and digital.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Analog Signals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analog signals exhibit a continuous range of intensity levels over time.</li>
                    <li>When an analog signal moves from one value to another, it traverses an infinite number of values
                        along its path.</li>
                    <li>This continuous variation allows analog signals to convey a wide range of information.</li>
                    <li>For example, the natural voice we hear is transmitted as an analog signal, providing a nuanced
                        representation of sound.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Digital Signals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In contrast, digital signals are characterized by having only a limited number of defined
                        values.</li>
                    <li>Although each value can theoretically be any number, it is often simplified to binary values: 1
                        and 0.</li>
                    <li>When represented graphically, a digital signal appears as a series of discrete steps or abrupt
                        transitions from one value to another.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Periodic Analog Signals</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Periodic analog signals can be classified as simple or composite. A simple periodic analog
                            signal, a sine wave, cannot be decomposed into simpler signals. A composite periodic analog
                            signal is composed of multiple sine waves.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Sine wave</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The sine wave is the most fundamental form of a periodic analog signal. When we visualize it
                            as
                            a simiple osciallting curve, its change over the course of a cycle is smooth and consistent,
                            a
                            continuous, rolling flow.</li>
                        <li>Each cycle consists of a single arc above the time axis followed by a single arc below it.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../../images/sinewave.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                    <ul>
                        <li>A sine wave, a fundamental concept in waveforms and signal processing, can be
                            comprehensively
                            characterized by three crucial parameters: the peak amplitude, the frequency, and the phase.
                            Together, these three parameters provide a complete and precise description of the behavior
                            and
                            characteristics of a sine wave.
                            <ol>
                                <li>Peak Amplitude: The peak amplitude of a sine wave represents the maximum value that
                                    the
                                    wave reaches in its oscillation. It essentially measures the wave's intensity or
                                    strength. In a graphical representation of a sine wave, it corresponds to the
                                    distance
                                    from the central axis (baseline) to the highest point the wave reaches in the
                                    positive
                                    direction and likewise for the lowest point in the negative direction. The peak
                                    amplitude defines the wave's scale and determines the magnitude of its effect in
                                    various
                                    applications.</li>
                                <li>Frequency: Frequency is a vital parameter that describes the number of oscillations
                                    or
                                    cycles that a sine wave completes in a given unit of time. It is usually measured in
                                    hertz (Hz), which represents cycles per second. In essence, frequency indicates how
                                    rapidly the wave repeats itself. High-frequency sine waves oscillate rapidly, while
                                    low-frequency sine waves oscillate more slowly. This parameter plays a significant
                                    role
                                    in applications such as audio signals, radio waves, and numerous other fields where
                                    the
                                    timing or periodicity of the wave is crucial.</li>
                                <li>Phase: The phase of a sine wave refers to its position in time relative to a
                                    reference
                                    point, often the beginning of a waveform cycle. It tells us where the wave is in its
                                    periodic motion at any given moment. Phase is typically expressed in degrees or
                                    radians
                                    and ranges from 0° to 360°. By adjusting the phase, we can shift the wave's starting
                                    point within its cycle, which is a fundamental concept in signal processing and
                                    synchronization. Phase information is especially crucial in fields like
                                    telecommunications, where the alignment of signals is essential for proper
                                    communication.</li>
                            </ol>
                            These three parameters, peak amplitude, frequency, and phase, collectively form the
                            foundation
                            for understanding and manipulating sine waves in various applications. Whether in audio
                            systems,
                            electronic circuits, or communication technologies, having a clear grasp of these parameters
                            allows engineers and scientists to precisely control and analyze the behavior of sine waves,
                            making them an indispensable tool in the realm of signal processing and waveform analysis.

                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Wavelength</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Wavelength is a fundamental characteristic of a signal as it
                            travels through a transmission medium. It plays a pivotal role in understanding the behavior
                            of
                            waves in various fields of science and technology.</li>

                        <li><strong>Relationship with Frequency and Speed:</strong> Wavelength is intrinsically linked
                            to
                            two other critical parameters: frequency and propagation speed. To truly grasp the
                            significance
                            of wavelength, it's essential to comprehend its relationship with these factors.

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Frequency represents the number of complete cycles or
                                    oscillations a wave undergoes per unit of time. It is usually measured in hertz
                                    (Hz). In
                                    a simple sine wave, the frequency corresponds to how rapidly the wave oscillates.
                                    Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional: as frequency increases,
                                    wavelength
                                    decreases, and vice versa. This relationship is described by the equation:

                                    Speed (v) = Frequency (f) × Wavelength (λ)

                        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Bandwidth is a critical concept in signal processing and
                            telecommunications. It refers to the range of frequencies within a signal or a communication
                            channel that can effectively carry information. Bandwidth is often expressed in hertz (Hz)
                            and represents the span of frequencies from the lowest to the highest that a system or
                            channel can accommodate.</li>

                        <li><strong>Relationship with Data Rate:</strong> The relationship between bandwidth and data
                            rate is fundamental. Bandwidth is directly linked to the rate at which information can be
                            transmitted through a channel. A wider bandwidth allows for a higher data rate, enabling the
                            transmission of more information in a given time frame. This relationship is governed by the
                            Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, which states that the maximum data rate (R) achievable in
                            a channel is directly proportional to its bandwidth (B):

                            characteristics for description. Unlike periodic analog signals, most digital signals are
                            nonperiodic, making traditional terms like "period" and "frequency" unsuitable. Instead, we

                <h3>Transmission Media Capability Factors</h3>
                <p>When designing a communication system, it's essential to consider various factors that affect the
                    effectiveness and reliability of data transmission. These factors collectively determine the
                    capabilities of the transmission medium employed. Understanding these key factors helps engineers
                    and network planners make informed decisions. Below are some critical capability factors that play a
                    pivotal role in shaping the performance of transmission media:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> Bandwidth refers to the data-carrying capacity of a channel or
                        medium. Higher bandwidth communication channels can support higher data rates, allowing for the
                        transmission of more information in a given period.</li>

                    <li><strong>Radiation:</strong> Radiation pertains to the unintended leakage of signals from the
                        medium, typically caused by undesirable electrical characteristics of the medium itself. This
                        phenomenon can result in interference and signal loss.</li>

                    <li><strong>Noise Absorption:</strong> Noise absorption is a measure of the medium's susceptibility
                        to external electrical noise. When a transmission medium is susceptible, it can pick up unwanted
                        electrical signals from the environment, leading to signal distortion. Noise absorption is a
                        critical factor in ensuring data integrity during transmission.</li>

                    <li><strong>Attenuation:</strong> Attenuation refers to the reduction in signal strength as it
                        propagates through the medium. The amount of energy lost depends on various factors, including
                        the frequency of the radiation and the physical characteristics of the medium. High-frequency
                        signals are more susceptible to attenuation. This phenomenon limits the usable distance that
                        data can travel through the medium and must be considered when designing communication systems.

                        chloride, fluoropolymer resin, or Teflon (r) and are twisted together in a helical form.</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="../../images/copper.svg" alt="Twisted Pair Cable" class="wb">

                <ul>
                    <li>In a twisted pair cable, one wire carries the signal, while the other wire is used for ground
                        reference. The receiver at the other end of the cable uses the difference between the two
                        signals to interpret the transmitted data.</li>

                    <li>The primary purpose of twisting the wires together is to reduce electrical interference from
                        other similar wire pairs in the surrounding environment. This interference reduction is crucial
                        for maintaining signal integrity.</li>

                    <li>The performance of a twisted pair cable improves with an increase in the number of twists per
                        foot, as this further reduces the susceptibility to external interference.</li>

                    <li>One important property of twisted pair cables is their gauge, which refers to the thickness or
                        diameter of the conductors. The gauge affects the cable's electrical characteristics and
                        performance.</li>

                    <li>The effective bandwidth of a twisted pair cable depends on several factors, including the
                        conductor's gauge, the length of the circuit, and the spacing of amplifiers (repeaters) along
                        the transmission path. These factors collectively determine the cable's ability to carry signals
                        at different frequencies.</li>

                    <li>Twisted pair cables can be used for transmitting both analog and digital signals. Their
                        frequency range typically spans from 100 Hz to 5 MHz, making them suitable for various
                        communication applications.</li>

                    <li>One of the most common applications of twisted pair cables is in telephone systems, where they
                        have been widely used for voice communication and, more recently, for broadband internet access.

                                interference, making them suitable for environments with high interference levels.</li>
                            <li>High Data Rates: They can support higher data rates and longer transmission distances
                                compared to UTP cables.</li>
                            <li>Reduced Crosstalk: STP cables reduce crosstalk (signal interference between adjacent
                                pairs) more effectively than UTP cables.</li>
                            <li>Reliability: STP cables are often chosen for critical applications where signal
                                integrity is paramount.</li>

                        <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cost: STP cables are typically more expensive than UTP cables due to the added shielding
                                material.</li>
                            <li>Rigidity: The additional shielding makes STP cables thicker and less flexible, which can

                <p><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of Twisted Pair Cable</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Twisted pair cables can carry both analog and digital data, making
                        them suitable for a wide range of applications, including telephone lines, Ethernet networks,
                        and more.</li>

                    <li><strong>Ease of Implementation:</strong> Implementing and terminating twisted pair cables is
                        relatively straightforward, even for those with limited technical expertise. This ease of use
                        contributes to their widespread adoption.</li>

                    <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Twisted pair cables are the most cost-effective medium for
                        short-distance data transmission. They are readily available and budget-friendly.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Poor Noise Immunity:</strong> Twisted pair cables offer limited noise immunity, making
                        them susceptible to external interference. This susceptibility can result in signal distortion
                        and reduced data integrity.</li>

                    <li><strong>High Attenuation:</strong> Twisted pair cables exhibit relatively high attenuation,
                        meaning that the signal strength diminishes as it travels over long distances. This can limit
                        the maximum distance data can be reliably transmitted without the use of repeaters or
                        amplifiers.</li>

                    <li><strong>Limited Bandwidth:</strong> Twisted pair cables support lower bandwidth compared to
                        other transmission media. For example, they typically support speeds of up to 10 Mbps for
                        distances of up to 100 meters in 10BASE-T Ethernet networks.</li>

                    <li><strong>Poor Security:</strong> Twisted pair cables offer minimal security against eavesdropping
                        and tapping. They can be relatively easy to intercept, making them less suitable for
                        applications that require high levels of data security.</li>

                    <li><strong>Fragility:</strong> Due to their relatively thin size, twisted pair cables are
                        susceptible to physical damage and breakage if not handled carefully. This fragility can lead to
                        signal interruptions and maintenance challenges.</li>

            <h2>Digital Transmission</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A computer network is designed to send information from one point to another. This information needs
                    to be converted to either a digital signal or an analog signal for transmission.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Modulation</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modulation</strong> is a fundamental process in digital communication, involving the
                    alteration of a signal's frequency to encode and carry data. In simpler terms, modulation is the
                    transformation of a digital signal into an analog signal.</li>
                <li>The complementary process of converting an analog signal back into a digital signal is known as
                    <strong>demodulation</strong>. The combined term <strong>MODEM</strong> is derived from "modulation"
                    and "demodulation" and is commonly used to refer to devices that perform both functions.
                </li>
                <li>When transmitting a signal from one computer to another over an analog channel, such as a telephone
                    line, signal conversion becomes necessary to ensure compatibility between digital data and analog
                    transmission media.</li>
                <li>Since computers generate digital signals, and telephone lines carry analog signals, modulation is
                    typically performed at the sending end to convert the digital data into a format suitable for analog
                    transmission.</li>
                <li>At the receiving end, the analog signal being carried by the telephone line must be converted back
                    into a digital signal through demodulation to retrieve the original digital data.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why Modulation is Necessary?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conversion between digital and analog signals is essential due to several reasons:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The data on the receiving side is in digital form and cannot be directly transmitted in its
                        digital state through analog transmission media. Hence, it must be converted into an analog
                        signal for effective transmission.</li>
                    <li>Many transmission media, such as telephone lines, are inherently analog in nature. Therefore,
                        data must be transformed into an analog signal via modulation for compatibility with these
                        transmission channels.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Applications of Modulation</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modulation is a critical process used when a signal requires transformation from one form to
                    another. It finds applications in various types of signal transformations:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Digital to digital conversion:</strong> In this scenario, modulation is used to encode
                        digital data for more efficient transmission within digital networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analog to digital conversion:</strong> Modulation techniques are employed to convert
                        analog signals into a digital format, making them compatible with digital networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital to analog conversion:</strong> When interfacing with analog transmission media,
                        modulation is necessary to convert digital data into analog signals for transmission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analog to analog conversion:</strong> In certain specialized situations, the
                        preservation of analog signals during transmission is vital, and modulation techniques are
                        utilized for this purpose.</li>

                            <ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Receiver: This is the starting point of the process. It represents the source of digital
                            data, which, in your example, is the sequence "10101." This data is the information you want
                            to transmit from one point to another.</li>
                        <li>Encoder: The digital data from the receiver is then passed through an encoder. The encoder's
                            role is to convert the digital data into a specific digital signal format suitable for
                            transmission over a communication channel. In line coding, this encoding process involves
                            mapping binary data (like "10101") to a specific pattern of signal levels.</li>
                        <li>Digital Signals Formation: After encoding, the data has been transformed into a digital
                            signal. In your diagram, this would be the sequence of signal levels that correspond to the
                            encoded data. The digital signal is typically a series of voltage levels or signal
                            transitions that represent the binary data.</li>
                        <li>Decoder: The encoded digital signal is transmitted through a communication channel, and at
                            the receiving end, it goes through a decoder. The decoder's role is to reverse the encoding
                            process, converting the received digital signal back into its original digital data format.

                        <li>It is available in four main types:

                            </ol>
                            Manchester and Differential Manchester are collectively referred to as biphase encoding, a
                            technique where transitions within the bit period carry information.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>NRZ:</strong> NRZ encoding uses two different voltage levels to represent binary
                            values:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>NRZ-L (Level Signals):</strong> In this variant, a continuous voltage level
                                    is maintained throughout a bit period to represent '1', and the absence of voltage
                                    represents '0'.</li>
                                <li><strong>NRZ-I (Inverted Signals):</strong> In NRZ-I, the voltage level changes
                                    whenever a '1' is encountered, and it remains constant for '0'.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <img src="../../images/nrli.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>RZ (Return to Zero):</strong> RZ is employed to address the synchronization issue
                            found in NRZ encoding. RZ uses three voltage levels:
                            <ul>
                                <li>+ve voltage &rarr; Represents '1'</li>
                                <li>-ve voltage &rarr; Represents '0'</li>
                                <li>Zero voltage &rarr; Represents neither '0' nor '1'</li>
                            </ul>
                            Unlike NRZ, where only one transition occurs within a bit period, RZ encoding allows for two
                            transitions in a single clock cycle.

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Manchester:</strong> Manchester encoding combines elements of RZ and NRZ-L. The bit
                            time, which is the time taken to transmit one bit, is divided into two halves. A transition
                            occurs in the middle of each bit, and the phase changes to represent different binary
                            values.</li>
                        <li><strong>Differential Manchester:</strong> This encoding scheme also combines aspects of RZ
                            and NRZ-I. It transitions at the middle of each bit but changes phase only when a '1' is
                            encountered. This ensures clock synchronization and provides a reliable means of data
                            transmission.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>It distinguishes between binary '0' and binary '1' by utilizing three voltage levels:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Positive voltage (+ve) represents binary '1.'</li>
                            <li>Negative voltage (-ve) represents binary '1.'</li>
                            <li>Zero voltage represents binary '0.'</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Binary '1' is represented by alternating between positive (+ve) and negative (-ve) voltages
                            within the signal.</li>
                        <li>This encoding scheme is characterized by its use of zero voltage to indicate binary '0,'
                            making it more resistant to baseline wander (a common issue in long-distance data
                            transmission).</li>
                        <li>The use of both positive and negative voltages to represent binary '1' allows for a balance
                            between the number of positive and negative pulses, helping to maintain the overall DC

                    <ul>
                        <li>The process of converting analog signal to digital signal is also known as digitizing.</li>
                        <li>In analog to digital conversion, information is converted from continuous waveform to a
                            series of bits (0 and 1).</li>
                        <li>The various techniques used to perform analog to digital conversion are shown below.</li>

                        <p><strong>PAM: Pulse Amplitude Modulation</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)</strong> is a modulation technique used in
                                digital communication that begins with an analog signal and samples it at a very high
                                speed. Its input is analog signal and output is digital signal.</li>
                            <li>Sampling in PAM involves measuring the amplitude of the analog signal at equal
                                intervals. The accuracy of the sampling process depends on the interval chosen; smaller
                                intervals result in higher accuracy. The sampling interval should ideally be at least
                                twice the frequency of the data signal. For example, if the data signal operates at 500
                                MHz, then the sampling rate should be 1000 samples per second, meaning the amplitude of
                                the signal is measured 1000 times per second.</li>
                            <li>Following the sampling process, PAM generates a series of pulses based on the results of
                                the sampling. These pulses represent discrete values of the original analog signal.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It's important to note that PAM does not provide a full-fledged method for converting
                                analog signals to digital signals; instead, it generates a pulse signal. While it may
                                not be a complete digital conversion method, PAM plays a crucial role in various
                                engineering applications. Furthermore, it serves as the initial step in Pulse Code
                                Modulation (PCM), making it an essential concept in the broader context of
                                analog-to-digital conversion.</li>

                        <p><strong>PCM: Pulse Code Modulation</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)</strong> is a widely used method in digital
                                communication for the precise representation and transmission of analog signals. It
                                involves a series of three essential processes, as depicted in the figure below:</li>
                        </ul>
                        <img src="../../images/pcm1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sampling:</strong> PCM starts with the sampling process, much like Pulse
                                Amplitude Modulation (PAM). During this phase, the continuous analog signal is
                                discretized by measuring its amplitude at regular intervals. This step transforms the
                                analog signal into a series of discrete samples.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quantization:</strong> Following the sampling stage, PCM quantizes the sampled
                                values by assigning integral values to each sample. This quantization process
                                effectively reduces the infinite number of possible signal amplitudes to a finite set of
                                discrete levels. The number of quantization levels determines the precision of the
                                digital representation; more levels provide higher fidelity but require more bits for
                                encoding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> In the final stage, the quantized values are encoded into a
                                digital format represented as a stream of binary bits. Each quantization level is
                                assigned a unique binary code, allowing the digital representation to accurately capture
                                the original analog signal's amplitude variations.</li>

                        <p><strong>DM: Delta Modulation </strong></p>
                        <p>Delta Modulation (DM) is a digital modulation technique developed to simplify the complexity
                            of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM).</p>

                        <p>While PCM determines the amplitude of a signal for each sample, DM focuses on detecting and
                            encoding only the changes in amplitude from one sample to the next.</p>

                        <p>In Delta Modulation, instead of generating codewords, individual bits are transmitted
                            sequentially, one after the other, to represent the signal.</p>
