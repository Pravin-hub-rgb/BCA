            <h2>Data Link Layer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Data Link Layer plays a crucial role in computer networking as it facilitates communication
                    between devices within the same network.</li>
                <li>This layer operates as a bridge between the Network Layer (Layer 3) and the Physical Layer (Layer 1)
                    in the OSI model.</li>
                <li>One of its primary responsibilities is to ensure reliable and error-free data transmission between
                    nodes or devices on a local network.</li>
                <li>Let's delve deeper into the various aspects of the Data Link Layer.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Moving Frames: One of the core responsibilities of the Data Link Layer is to move data frames
                        from one network node to another.
                        <ul>
                            <li>These frames are the fundamental units of data transmission within a network.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Frame Division: Before transmission, the Data Link Layer divides the continuous stream of data
                        received from the Network Layer into manageable chunks known as frames.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each frame consists of two essential components: the header and the actual data.</li>
                            <li>The header contains crucial information, such as source and destination addresses, which
                                are
                                vital for routing and ensuring that the data reaches its intended recipient.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="wh">
                    <p><b>Physical Addressing</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In networking, addressing is essential for identifying and routing data to the correct
                            destination.</li>
                        <li>Within the Data Link Layer, physical addressing is a key concept.</li>
                        <li>There are three types of addresses involved in networking: port addresses, logical
                            addresses, and physical addresses.</li>
                        <li>The physical address, often referred to as the Media Access Control (MAC) address, plays a
                            pivotal role in data link layer operations.</li>
                        <li>Here are some key points regarding physical addressing:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>MAC Address</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>MAC Address: MAC addresses are unique, 48-bit (6-byte) identifiers assigned to network
                            interface cards (NICs).</li>
                        <li>These addresses are hardwired into the NIC and cannot be changed.</li>
                        <li>The Data Link Layer is responsible for providing and managing MAC addresses, ensuring that
                            each network device has a unique identifier.</li>
                        <li>This addressing mechanism is essential for devices to communicate within the local network.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b>Flow Control</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Effective communication between network devices relies on a balanced flow of data.</li>
                        <li>In situations where the sender's data rate exceeds the receiver's capacity, issues like data
                            loss and network congestion can occur.</li>
                        <li>Flow control mechanisms implemented at the Data Link Layer help manage this data flow.</li>
                        <li>Here's an explanation of flow control:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Flow Control Mechanism</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flow Control Mechanism: Flow control mechanisms prevent data overload on the receiver
                            side.</li>
                        <li>For example, if the sender is transmitting data at a rate of 10 frames per second, while
                            the receiver can only handle 5 frames per second, a flow control mechanism comes into
                            play.</li>
                        <li>It may involve the use of buffers to store excess frames while the receiver processes
                            them.</li>
                        <li>This ensures that data transmission remains efficient even when sender and receiver
                            speeds differ.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="wh">
                    <p><b>Error Control</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In any data transmission, errors can occur due to various factors, such as electromagnetic
                            interference, signal attenuation, or data corruption during transmission.</li>
                        <li>The Data Link Layer includes error control mechanisms to detect and, in some cases, correct
                            these errors.</li>
                        <li>Error control encompasses two primary functions:</li>
                        <p>Error Detection</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Error Detection: This function involves identifying errors in received data frames.</li>
                            <li>For instance, if a sender transmits a sequence of bits (e.g., 10101100), and the
                                receiver receives a slightly altered sequence (e.g., 10101111), error detection
                                mechanisms are employed to pinpoint which bits have changed and assess the extent of the
                                error.</li>
                            <li>Common techniques include checksums and CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check).</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Error Correction</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Error Correction: In some cases, error correction is essential.</li>
                            <li>This function aims to not only detect errors but also correct them.</li>
                            <li>Methods like Hamming codes or Reed-Solomon codes are used for error correction,
                                ensuring
                                that data integrity is maintained even in the presence of errors introduced during
                                transmission.</li>
