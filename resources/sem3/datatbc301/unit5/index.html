            <h2>Transport Layer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The network layer is responsible for host-to-host communication at the computer level, delivering
                    messages only to the destination computer.</li>
                <li>However, this delivery is incomplete, as the message still needs to be directed to the specific
                    computer process. Therefore, the primary role of the transport layer is to provide communication
                    services directly to the application processes running on different hosts.</li>
                <li>The transport layer establishes a logical communication channel between application processes on
                    different hosts. Despite not being physically connected, application processes utilize the logical
                    communication facilitated by the transport layer to exchange messages.</li>
                <li>For instance, when using WhatsApp on a mobile phone, the connection between two phones is
                    established by the network layer, but the communication between my WhatsApp application and my
                    friend's WhatsApp application is facilitated by the transport layer.

                </li>
                <li>The transport layer protocol is specifically responsible for delivering messages to the appropriate
                    process. It ensures end-to-end or process-to-process communication, addressing the intricacies
                    (complexities) of
                    connecting and communicating between specific applications running on different hosts.</li>
                <li>
                    Common transport layer protocols include Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User
                    Datagram Protocol (UDP), each offering different features and trade-offs in terms of
                    reliability and speed.</li>
                <li>Transport layer protocols use port numbers to identify specific processes on a host,
                    enabling the correct delivery of messages to the intended applications.</li>
                <li>Through flow control and error detection mechanisms, the transport layer ensures reliable
                    and ordered delivery of messages between applications.</li>
                <li>Transport layer services contribute to the abstraction of the underlying network
                    complexities, allowing application developers to focus on high-level communication without
                    worrying about the complexities of network configuration.</li>

                <h3>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) vs. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked
                                delivery of data between applications.</li>
                            <li>It establishes a virtual circuit or connection between the sender and receiver before
                                exchanging data, ensuring that data is delivered accurately and in the correct order.
                            </li>
                            <li>TCP includes features such as flow control, acknowledgment of received data, and
                                retransmission of lost or corrupted packets to guarantee the integrity of the
                                communication.</li>
                            <li>Example: Web browsing, file transfer (e.g., FTP), and email (e.g., SMTP) commonly use
                                TCP to ensure accurate and complete data delivery.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>User Datagram Protocol (UDP):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides faster, simpler, and less reliable
                                communication compared to TCP.</li>
                            <li>It does not establish a dedicated connection before data transfer, and it does not
                                perform error checking or retransmission of lost packets.</li>
                            <li>UDP is suitable for applications where speed and low overhead are prioritized over
                                guaranteed data delivery, such as real-time applications like online gaming, live
                                streaming, and voice over IP (VoIP).</li>
                            <li>Example: Domain Name System (DNS) uses UDP for quick and lightweight communication to
                                resolve domain names to IP addresses.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Comparison:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>TCP is ideal for applications that require reliable, ordered, and error-checked
                                delivery, making it suitable for scenarios where data accuracy is crucial.</li>
                            <li>UDP, on the other hand, is suitable for applications where speed and simplicity are
                                prioritized, and occasional packet loss or disorder is acceptable.</li>
                            <li>The choice between TCP and UDP depends on the specific requirements of the application
                                and the trade-offs between reliability and speed.</li>

                <h3>Services provided by the Transport Layer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The services offered by the transport layer share similarities with those of the data link
                        layer. While the data link layer operates within a single network, the transport layer extends
                        its services across an internetwork, encompassing multiple interconnected networks. Unlike the
                        data link layer, which governs the physical layer, the transport layer exercises control over
                        all the lower layers of the OSI model.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The services provided by transport layer protocols can be categorized into five main areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>End-to-End Delivery:</strong> Ensuring the reliable delivery of messages between the
                        source and destination, regardless of the number of intermediate networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Addressing:</strong> Managing the addressing scheme to identify the source and
                        destination processes in the communication.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reliable Delivery:</strong> Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data delivery
                        through:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Error Control: Detecting and correcting errors in transmitted data.</li>
                            <li>Sequence Control: Maintaining the correct order of data packets during transmission.
                            </li>
                            <li>Loss Control: Minimizing data loss during the transmission process.</li>
                            <li>Duplication Control: Preventing the occurrence of duplicated data packets.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Flow Control:</strong> Managing the rate of data transmission to prevent overwhelming
                        the receiving device or network.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Multiplexing:</strong> Efficiently handling multiple communication streams through:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Upward Multiplexing: Combining data streams from multiple processes into a single
                                communication channel.</li>
                            <li>Downward Multiplexing: Distributing data streams from a single source process to
                                multiple destination processes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) operates at the Transport Layer and is an integral part of the
                        Internet Protocol suite, commonly known as UDP/IP suite.</li>
                    <li>Unlike Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), UDP is characterized as an unreliable and
                        connectionless protocol. Consequently, there is no need to establish a dedicated connection
                        before initiating data transfer.</li>
                    <li>While TCP is the predominant transport layer protocol for most Internet services, providing
                        guaranteed delivery, reliability, and additional features, these benefits come with added
                        overhead and latency.</li>
                    <li>UDP, on the other hand, plays a crucial role in scenarios that demand real-time services, such
                        as online gaming, voice or video communication, and live conferences. In these applications,
                        where high performance is paramount, UDP allows packets to be dropped instead of processing
                        delayed packets. Notably, UDP lacks error checking, resulting in bandwidth savings.</li>
                    <li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) stands out for its efficiency in terms of both latency and
                        bandwidth, making it a preferred choice for time-sensitive and performance-critical
                        applications.</li>

                <div class="in">
                    <p><strong>UDP Header</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The UDP header is a fixed and simple 8-byte structure, in contrast to TCP, which can vary in
                            size from 20 to 60 bytes.</li>
                        <li>The first 8 bytes of the UDP header contain all the necessary information, while the
                            remaining part is dedicated to data transmission.</li>
                        <li>UDP port number fields are each 16 bits long, allowing for a port number range defined from
                            0 to 65535. Port number 0 is reserved for special purposes. These port numbers play a
                            crucial role in distinguishing between different user requests or processes.</li>

                                <li><strong>Length:</strong> Indicates the total length of the UDP datagram, including
                                    both the header and the data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Checksum:</strong> Facilitates error detection, ensuring the integrity of

                    <h3>Applications of UDP:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used for simple request-response communication when the data size is small, reducing
                            concerns about flow and error control.</li>
                        <li>Suitable for multicasting due to its support for packet switching.</li>
                        <li>Utilized in routing update protocols like RIP (Routing Information Protocol).</li>
                        <li>Preferred for real-time applications that cannot tolerate uneven delays in message sections.
                        </li>
                        <li>Implementations using UDP as a transport layer protocol include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>NTP (Network Time Protocol)</li>
                                <li>DNS (Domain Name Service)</li>
                                <li>BOOTP, DHCP</li>
                                <li>NNP (Network News Protocol)</li>
                                <li>Quote of the day protocol</li>
                                <li>TFTP, RTSP, RIP</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Tasks performed by the application layer through UDP:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Trace Route</li>
                                <li>Record Route</li>
                                <li>Timestamp</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>UDP takes a datagram from the Network Layer, attaches its header, and swiftly sends it to
                            the user, contributing to its fast operation.</li>
                        <li>UDP is considered a null protocol if you remove the checksum field, reducing the demand on
                            computer resources.</li>
                        <li>Effective when using Multicast or Broadcast for data transfer.</li>
                        <li>Commonly employed for the transmission of real-time packets, particularly in multimedia
                            applications.</li>
                    </ul>
