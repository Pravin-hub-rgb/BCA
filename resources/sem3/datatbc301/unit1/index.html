                <h3>Connecting Networks: Broadcast and Point-to-Point</h3>
                <p>After understanding topologies, we delve into different types of network connections.</p>
                <p><strong>Broadcast Network</strong></p>
                <p>In a broadcast network, all devices share the same communication medium and can send their messages
                    to all other devices on the network. It's like broadcasting a message to everyone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Efficient for broadcasting information to all devices simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Prone to congestion as all devices compete for the same channel.</li>
                    <li>Security concerns arise as all devices receive all messages.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Point-to-Point Network</strong></p>
                <p>In a point-to-point network, devices have dedicated communication links. This type of connection is
                    often seen in a more traditional client-server architecture.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offers direct, dedicated communication between devices.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced security since only intended recipients receive messages.</li>
                    <li>Requires more connections as the network expands.</li>
                    <li>Less efficient for broadcasting messages to all devices.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Understanding network topologies aids in deciding which connection type is suitable for different
                    scenarios.</p>

        <h1>Modes of Communication</h1>
        <p>Communication modes refer to the direction and flow of data transmission between devices in a network.
            <br>This determine how data transmission occurs between devices in terms of direction and availability of
            communication channels.
        </p>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Three primary modes of communications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Simplex Mode:</b> In simplex mode, data can only flow in one direction. One device is the sender,
                    and
                    the other device is the receiver. The receiver can only receive data, and the sender can only send
                    data. There is no two-way communication. The receiver can't send data back to the sender on the same
                    channel. This mode is analogous to a one-way street. Examples of simplex mode include radio and
                    television
                    broadcasting, where the information flows from the broadcaster to the viewers, but viewers cannot
                    send any data back.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Half Duplex Mode:</b> In half duplex mode, data can flow in both directions, but not
                    simultaneously.
                    Devices can either send or receive data at any given time, but they cannot do both simultaneously.
                    Think of it as a walkie-talkie communication, where users must press a button to talk (send) and
                    release it to listen (receive).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Full Duplex Mode:</b> In full duplex mode, data can flow in both directions simultaneously.
                    Devices can
                    send and receive data at the same time, allowing for two-way communication. Full duplex
                    communication is commonly used in modern computer networks, where devices can both send and receive
                    data packets simultaneously.

            <h2>Protocols and Standards</h2>
            <p>Protocols are rules and conventions that devices follow to enable communication. Standards provide a
                common framework to ensure compatibility and interoperability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> Defines how data should be formatted, transmitted, received, and
                    interpreted. Ensures consistency in communication across devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Standard:</strong> Establishes guidelines and specifications for devices and systems to
                    ensure they work together seamlessly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Protocols and standards work hand in hand to create a reliable and organized communication environment in

        <h1>OSI model</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the
                functions of a communication or networking system into distinct layers. It was developed by the
                International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to ensure that different networking
                technologies could work together seamlessly. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The OSI model consists of seven layers, each responsible for specific tasks in the communication process:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Physical Layer : </b> This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over a physical
                medium, such as cables or wireless signals. It focuses on characteristics like voltage levels, data
                rates, and physical connectors.</li>
            <li><b>Data Link Layer </b>: The data link layer is responsible for framing data into packets, error
                detection
                and correction, and managing access to the physical medium through protocols like Ethernet.</li>
            <li><b>Network Layer </b>: The network layer handles routing and forwarding of data packets. It
                establishes
                logical paths (routes) for data to travel between source and destination devices.</li>
            <li><b>Transport Layer </b>: This layer ensures end-to-end communication, managing data segmentation,
                flow
                control, and error recovery. It guarantees reliable data delivery between devices.</li>
            <li><b>Session Layer </b>: The session layer manages sessions (connections) between devices, including
                establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections. It also handles synchronization and data
                exchange coordination.</li>
            <li><b>Presentation Layer </b>: Responsible for data translation, encryption, compression, and other
                transformations to ensure that data sent from one device can be understood by the receiving device.
            </li>
            <li><b>Application Layer </b> : The topmost layer interacts directly with the end user and provides
                various
                application-level services such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/layer1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
        <p>The OSI model is a reference framework, not an actual implementation. It serves as a guide for creating
            protocols and networking technologies that can work together. When data is transmitted between two
            devices in a network using the OSI model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Data Generation </b>: The application layer on the sending device generates the data to be
                transmitted.</li>
            <li><b>Layer-by-Layer Processing </b>: As the data moves down the OSI layers, each layer adds its header
                or
                encapsulation, preparing the data for transmission.</li>
            <li><b>Transmission </b>: The data is transmitted over the physical medium through the physical and data
                link
                layers.</li>
            <li><b>Reception </b>: The receiving device processes the incoming data in reverse order, stripping off
                headers
                added by each layer.</li>
            <li><b>Delivery to Application </b>: The processed data is delivered to the application layer on the
                receiving
                device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The OSI model helps in understanding and troubleshooting networking protocols and technologies. It also
            aids in designing new protocols and technologies by providing a clear structure for communication
            functions. However, in practice, most networking models, like TCP/IP, combine some of the OSI layers for
            efficiency and practicality.</p>

            <p>
                When data is being sent from a device (the sender) to another device (the receiver) over a network,
                the OSI model's seven layers play a role in both the sender's and receiver's networking stacks. Each
                layer adds its own header or encapsulation to the data as it moves down the stack on the sender's
                side, and then removes those headers in reverse order as the data moves up the stack on the
                receiver's side. Let's break down how the layers are stacked on both sides:
