                <h3>Connecting Networks: Broadcast and Point-to-Point</h3>
                <p>After understanding topologies, we delve into different types of network connections.</p>
                <p><strong>Broadcast Network</strong></p>
                <p>In a broadcast network, all devices share the same communication medium and can send their messages
                    to all other devices on the network. It's like broadcasting a message to everyone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Efficient for broadcasting information to all devices simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Prone to congestion as all devices compete for the same channel.</li>
                    <li>Security concerns arise as all devices receive all messages.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Point-to-Point Network</strong></p>
                <p>In a point-to-point network, devices have dedicated communication links. This type of connection is
                    often seen in a more traditional client-server architecture.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offers direct, dedicated communication between devices.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced security since only intended recipients receive messages.</li>
                    <li>Requires more connections as the network expands.</li>
                    <li>Less efficient for broadcasting messages to all devices.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Understanding network topologies aids in deciding which connection type is suitable for different
                    scenarios.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Repeater</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A repeater operates at the Physical layer of the networking model.</li>
                    <li>Its primary function is to receive incoming signals, and subsequently, re-transmit these signals
                        to extend their reach over longer distances. Essentially, repeaters help overcome the
                        limitations of signal attenuation during transmission.</li>
                    <li>Contrary to common belief, repeaters do not amplify the signal. Instead, when the signal
                        weakens, repeaters replicate the signal's data bit by bit and then regenerate it back to its
                        original strength. This process ensures that the signal remains intelligible and usable despite
                        the distance it travels.</li>
                    <li>Structurally, repeaters are designed with two ports: one for signal input and another for signal
                        output. This allows them to intercept incoming signals, reinvigorate them, and then forward them
                        to the next segment of the network.</li>
                    <li>Limitations: While repeaters are effective at combating signal degradation, they are not a
                        universal solution. They cannot address issues like latency, noise, or errors introduced during
                        transmission. For these challenges, other networking components like routers, switches, and
                        error correction mechanisms come into play.</li>
                    <li>Chain of Repeaters: In scenarios where very long distances need to be covered, a chain of
                        repeaters can be used. Each repeater in the chain restores and retransmits the signal, further
                        extending its reach.</li>
                    <li>Application: Repeaters find use in various communication mediums, including wired and wireless
                        networks. For example, they are employed in Ethernet networks to counteract signal degradation
                        over lengthy cable runs.</li>

                <h3>Hub</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A hub functions as a multi-port networking device, similar to a multiport repeater, due to its
                        ability to regenerate and distribute signals to multiple connected devices.</li>
                    <li>Operating primarily at the Physical layer of networking, a hub's primary role is to facilitate
                        connections among computers within a Local Area Network (LAN), allowing them to communicate and
                        share resources.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hubs are of three types:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Active hub: Equipped with its own power supply, the active hub not only rejuvenates weak signals
                        but also amplifies and reinforces them across the network. Essentially functioning as both a
                        repeater and a central point for connecting cables, the active hub enhances signal quality and
                        serves as a distribution hub.</li>
                    <li>Passive hub: This hub serves as a collection point for network nodes' wiring while drawing its
                        power supply from an active hub. It does not possess signal amplification capabilities but
                        rather facilitates the physical interconnection of devices within the network.</li>
                    <li>Intelligent hub: Operating in a manner similar to an active hub, the intelligent hub offers the
                        additional feature of remote management capabilities. This enables network administrators to
                        monitor and manage the hub's performance, connections, and potentially connected devices from a
                        central location.</li>

                <h3>Bridge</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Operating at the Data Link layer of the networking model, a bridge is a device that combines the
                        functionalities of a repeater with the ability to intelligently filter content based on the
                        source and destination MAC addresses.</li>
                    <li>Bridges serve as a means of interconnecting two separate Local Area Networks (LANs) that operate
                        on the same network protocol, extending network connectivity.</li>
                    <li>Unlike hubs, which indiscriminately broadcast data to all connected devices, bridges implement a
                        level of intelligence by selectively transmitting data only to the devices that require it. This
                        filtering is achieved by examining the MAC addresses of both the source and destination devices
                        in the data frame.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Filtering Mechanism: A bridge maintains a table known as a MAC address table or bridge table.
                        This table records the MAC addresses of devices connected to each of its ports. When a data
                        frame arrives, the bridge checks the destination MAC address against the entries in its table
                        and forwards the frame only to the port associated with the destination device, reducing
                        unnecessary network traffic and improving efficiency.</li>

                <h3>Switch</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Functioning at the Data Link layer of the networking model, a switch is a multiport networking
                        device that builds upon the foundation of a bridge. It combines intelligent content filtering
                        with enhanced efficiency and performance features.</li>
                    <li>Similar to a multiport bridge, a switch includes additional capabilities, such as buffering and
                        specialized design considerations, that contribute to its improved performance compared to
                        traditional bridges.</li>
                    <li>One of the key differentiators between a switch and a bridge lies in the number of available
                        ports. While bridges typically have only two ports, switches are designed with multiple ports,
                        enabling numerous devices to simultaneously establish connections and communicate.</li>
                    <li>Unlike older networking setups where bridges could transmit data only between two devices at a
                        time, switches can concurrently process data from multiple devices, reducing latency and
                        enhancing overall network throughput.</li>
                    <li>Similar to bridges, switches also employ MAC address tables to learn the association between MAC
                        addresses and the corresponding switch ports. As devices transmit data, the switch populates its
                        table to optimize data forwarding.</li>

                <h3>Router</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A router is a device similar to a switch, but it operates by directing data packets based on
                        their IP addresses.</li>
                    <li>Its primary role falls within the network layer of networking.</li>
                    <li>While a switch excels at connecting devices within a network, a router has the unique ability to
                        connect different networks together, including LANs and WANs.</li>
                    <li>One distinctive feature of routers is their dynamically updated routing table. This table acts
                        as a map that guides routers in deciding where to send data. It holds vital information,
                        including various IP addresses.</li>
                    <li>Routers are like postal workers for the internet. They look at IP addresses on data packets and
                        decide how to best deliver them, ensuring data reaches its intended destination.</li>
                    <li> Routers play a critical role in managing internet traffic. They determine the fastest and most
                        efficient paths for data to travel across the complex web of networks that make up the internet.

                        networks.</li>
                    <li>A gateway can take various forms, such as a router, firewall, server, or other devices. Its role
                        is to allow traffic to smoothly enter and exit a network.</li>
                    <li>One of the key roles of a gateway is to translate data between different network protocols. This
                        is crucial when connecting networks that use different rules for communication.</li>
                    <li> A gateway acts as a mediator, helping networks with different communication methods understand
                        and exchange information.</li>
                    <li>In the context of the internet, a gateway often refers to a device that connects a local network
                        to the broader internet, managing data flow and security.</li>

        <h1>Modes of Communication</h1>
        <p>Communication modes refer to the direction and flow of data transmission between devices in a network.
            <br>This determine how data transmission occurs between devices in terms of direction and availability of
            communication channels.
        </p>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Three primary modes of communications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Simplex Mode:</b> In simplex mode, data can only flow in one direction. One device is the sender,
                    and
                    the other device is the receiver. The receiver can only receive data, and the sender can only send
                    data. There is no two-way communication. The receiver can't send data back to the sender on the same
                    channel. This mode is analogous to a one-way street. Examples of simplex mode include radio and
                    television
                    broadcasting, where the information flows from the broadcaster to the viewers, but viewers cannot
                    send any data back.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Half Duplex Mode:</b> In half duplex mode, data can flow in both directions, but not
                    simultaneously.
                    Devices can either send or receive data at any given time, but they cannot do both simultaneously.
                    Think of it as a walkie-talkie communication, where users must press a button to talk (send) and
                    release it to listen (receive).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Full Duplex Mode:</b> In full duplex mode, data can flow in both directions simultaneously.
                    Devices can
                    send and receive data at the same time, allowing for two-way communication. Full duplex
                    communication is commonly used in modern computer networks, where devices can both send and receive
                    data packets simultaneously.

                <li>The need for a standardized framework became apparent as networks expanded and connected globally.
                    The introduction of the OSI Model aimed to establish a common reference point for how networks
                    should be designed, operated, and interconnected, regardless of their underlying hardware or
                    software.</li>
                <li>Key Reasons for its Introduction:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interoperability: The primary goal of the OSI Model was to enable seamless communication
                            between devices made by different manufacturers. By defining a set of protocols and
                            standards, it ensured that devices could understand each other's signals and data formats.
                        </li>
                        <li>Uniformity: Before the OSI Model, networking protocols varied widely. The model introduced a
                            structured framework with distinct layers, each responsible for specific functions. This
                            layering approach promoted consistency and simplified troubleshooting.</li>
                        <li>Global Connectivity: As networking expanded beyond individual organizations and crossed
                            national borders, the OSI Model became vital for enabling international data exchange. It
                            facilitated connections between networks with different technologies and protocols.</li>
                        <li>Framework for Development: The model provided a foundation for the development of new
                            networking technologies and protocols. Engineers and developers could design components to
                            align with the OSI layers, making it easier to create compatible and interoperable systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>Educational Tool: The OSI Model serves as an educational tool, offering a conceptual
                            framework for understanding how data moves through networks. It aids students,
                            professionals, and network administrators in comprehending complex networking concepts.</li>
                        <li>Evolution and Adaptation: While the OSI Model has evolved since its introduction, its core
                            concepts remain relevant. Its design influenced the development of real-world protocols like
                            TCP/IP, which underpins the modern internet.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In essence, the OSI Model was introduced to solve the challenges of disparate networking
                    technologies, promoting global connectivity, standardization, and interoperability. It continues to
                    be a foundational framework that shapes the design and operation of networks, ensuring effective
                    communication in today's interconnected world."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The OSI model consists of seven layers, each responsible for specific tasks in the communication process:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Physical Layer : </b> This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over a physical
                medium, such as cables or wireless signals. It focuses on characteristics like voltage levels, data
                rates, and physical connectors.</li>
            <li><b>Data Link Layer </b>: The data link layer is responsible for framing data into packets, error
                detection
                and correction, and managing access to the physical medium through protocols like Ethernet.</li>
            <li><b>Network Layer </b>: The network layer handles routing and forwarding of data packets. It
                establishes
                logical paths (routes) for data to travel between source and destination devices.</li>
            <li><b>Transport Layer </b>: This layer ensures end-to-end communication, managing data segmentation,
                flow
                control, and error recovery. It guarantees reliable data delivery between devices.</li>
            <li><b>Session Layer </b>: The session layer manages sessions (connections) between devices, including
                establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections. It also handles synchronization and data
                exchange coordination.</li>
            <li><b>Presentation Layer </b>: Responsible for data translation, encryption, compression, and other
                transformations to ensure that data sent from one device can be understood by the receiving device.
            </li>
            <li><b>Application Layer </b> : The topmost layer interacts directly with the end user and provides
                various
                application-level services such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/layer1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
        <p>The OSI model is a reference framework, not an actual implementation. It serves as a guide for creating
            protocols and networking technologies that can work together. When data is transmitted between two
            devices in a network using the OSI model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Data Generation </b>: The application layer on the sending device generates the data to be
                transmitted.</li>
            <li><b>Layer-by-Layer Processing </b>: As the data moves down the OSI layers, each layer adds its header
                or
                encapsulation, preparing the data for transmission.</li>
            <li><b>Transmission </b>: The data is transmitted over the physical medium through the physical and data
                link
                layers.</li>
            <li><b>Reception </b>: The receiving device processes the incoming data in reverse order, stripping off
                headers
                added by each layer.</li>
            <li><b>Delivery to Application </b>: The processed data is delivered to the application layer on the
                receiving
                device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The OSI model helps in understanding and troubleshooting networking protocols and technologies. It also
            aids in designing new protocols and technologies by providing a clear structure for communication
            functions. However, in practice, most networking models, like TCP/IP, combine some of the OSI layers for
            efficiency and practicality.</p>
        <div class="in">
            <p>
                When data is being sent from a device (the sender) to another device (the receiver) over a network,
                the OSI model's seven layers play a role in both the sender's and receiver's networking stacks. Each
                layer adds its own header or encapsulation to the data as it moves down the stack on the sender's
                side, and then removes those headers in reverse order as the data moves up the stack on the
                receiver's side. Let's break down how the layers are stacked on both sides:
                <br><img src="../../images/layer2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="t13" class="wh">
            <h2>TCP/IP Protocol Suite</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed prior to the OSI model. Therefore, the layers in the
                    TCP/IP protocol suite do not exactly match those in the OSI model.</li>
                <li>The original TCP/IP protocol suite was defined as having four layers: host-to-network, internet,
                    transport, and application. However, when TCP/IP is compared to OSI, we can say that the
                    host-to-network layer is equivalent to the combination of the physical and data link layers. The
                    internet layer is equivalent to the network layer, and the application layer is roughly doing the
                    job of the session, presentation, and application layers with the transport layer in TCP/IP taking
                    care of part of the duties of the session layer</li>
                <li>We will assume that the TCP/IP protocol suite is made of five layers: physical, data link, network,
                    transport, and application. The first four layers provide physical standards, network interfaces,
                    internet working, and transport functions that correspond to the first four layers of the OSI model.
                    The three topmost layers in the OSI model, however, are represented in TCPIIP by a single layer
                    called the application layer.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/tcpipsuite.svg" alt="tcp" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, each of which provides a specific
                    functionality. However, the modules are not necessarily interdependent.</li>
                <li>Whereas the OSI model specifies which functions belong to each of its layers, the layers of the
                    TCP/IP protocol suite contain relatively independent protocols that can be mixed and matched
                    depending on the needs of the system. This flexibility is a defining feature of TCP/IP.</li>
                <li>The term 'hierarchical' means that each upper-level protocol is supported by one or more lower-level
                    protocols. This arrangement ensures that different layers work together seamlessly to deliver data
                    across networks.</li>
                <li>At the transport layer, TCP/IP defines three protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User
                    Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). These protocols offer
                    different methods of data transmission, each tailored to specific requirements.</li>
                <li>At the network layer, the main protocol defined by TCP/IP is the Internetworking Protocol (IP). IP
                    is the backbone of the internet, responsible for routing and addressing packets of data across
                    networks. In addition to IP, there are other protocols that support data movement within this layer.
                </li>
                <li>The TCP/IP model's design allows for adaptability and efficiency. The independence of protocols
                    within its layers enables network architects to create solutions that suit various networking
                    scenarios. This modular approach, combined with the model's longevity and robustness, has
                    contributed to the enduring success of TCP/IP as the foundational protocol suite of the internet."

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Link Layer / Network Access Layer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Link Layer, also known as the Network Access Layer, deals with the physical transmission of
                        raw data bits over a physical medium, such as copper wires, optical fibers, or wireless
                        frequencies. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural details for transmitting data
                        between devices.</li>
                    <li>At this layer, TCP/IP doesn't define any specific protocol but is designed to support a wide
                        range of standard and proprietary protocols that operate at these layers. This flexibility
                        allows TCP/IP to adapt to different network technologies and environments. A TCP/IP internetwork
                        can incorporate various types of networks, whether they're local-area networks (LANs) or
                        wide-area networks (WANs). This adaptability is one of the strengths of TCP/IP, as it enables
                        networks of different scales and types to interconnect seamlessly while utilizing the
                        appropriate protocols for their specific requirements.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Internet Layer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Internet Layer, also known as the Network Layer, handles routing and forwarding of data
                        packets across networks. It's primarily based on the Internet Protocol (IP), which is
                        responsible for addressing, routing, and fragmenting data for transmission.</li>
                    <li>Within the Internet Layer, there are four essential supporting protocols:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Internet Protocol (IP):</b> IP is the backbone of the TCP/IP protocols, responsible
                                for transmitting data across networks. It operates as an unreliable and connectionless
                                protocol, providing a best-effort delivery service. This 'best effort' approach means
                                that IP doesn't perform error checking or tracking and assumes the underlying layers are
                                not perfect, aiming to get data to its destination without guarantees.</li>
                            <li><b>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):</b> ARP associates a logical address with a
                                physical address, aiding in finding the physical address when the Internet address is
                                known.</li>
                            <li><b>Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP):</b> RARP helps a host discover its
                                Internet address when it only knows its physical address, often used when a computer is
                                connected to a network for the first time.</li>
                            <li><b>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP):</b> ICMP is used for hosts and gateways to
                                send notifications about datagram issues back to the sender, handling query and error
                                reporting messages.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>These protocols working together within the network layer of TCP/IP play a crucial role in
                        ensuring effective communication, managing issues, and enabling specific types of transmissions.

                <h3>Transport Layer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Transport Layer manages end-to-end communication and data flow between two devices. It
                        offers two main protocols:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):</b> TCP provides reliable and ordered data
                                transmission with connection setup. It ensures that data is delivered accurately and in
                                the correct order. TCP operates as a connection-oriented protocol, establishing a
                                connection before data transmission.</li>
                            <li><b>User Datagram Protocol (UDP):</b> UDP offers fast, connectionless data transmission
                                without reliability guarantees. It is suitable for applications where speed is
                                prioritized over reliability. UDP adds basic port addresses, checksum error control, and
                                length information to the upper-layer data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Additionally, a newer protocol called Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) has been
                        introduced to cater to the needs of certain modern applications, combining features of both TCP
                        and UDP.</li>
                    <li>These protocols within the transport layer play a critical role in managing how data is
                        delivered, ensuring reliability, and accommodating various communication needs.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Application Layer in TCP/IP serves a role equivalent to the combined Session, Presentation,
                        and Application Layers in the OSI model. This layer is home to numerous protocols that
                        facilitate various functionalities.</li>
                    <li>The Application Layer in TCP/IP is the topmost layer and plays a crucial role in enabling
                        communication between software applications and the underlying network. It's responsible for

                        <ul>
                            <li>Data Formatting and Translation: The Application Layer handles the formatting,
                                structure, and presentation of data in a way that is understandable by both the sender
                                and the receiver.</li>
                            <li>User Interface and Interaction: Providing user interfaces for applications, allowing
                                users to interact with software and handling user authentication and security.</li>
                            <li>Application Protocols: Defining various protocols that applications use to exchange
                                data, such as HTTP (for web browsing), SMTP (for email), FTP (for file transfer), and
                                DNS (for domain name resolution).</li>
                            <li>Data Encryption and Security: Implementing security features and encryption methods to

                <h3>Purpose of Multiplexing:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The transmission medium can only handle one signal at a time, necessitating multiplexing when
                        multiple signals need to share it.</li>
                    <li>To divide the medium's available bandwidth so that each signal gets its share. For example, if
                        there
                        are 10 signals and 100 units of bandwidth, each signal gets 10 units.</li>
                    <li>Prevents collisions when multiple signals share a common medium.</li>
                    <li>Helps save on expensive transmission services.</li>

                    <li>Multiplexing has a long history:</li>
                    <li>Originated in telegraphy in the early 1870s.</li>
                    <li>Widely used in telecommunications, where multiple telephone calls are carried through a single
                        wire.
                    </li>
                    <li>George Owen Squier's development of telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910 was a significant
                        milestone.</li>

                        Frequency multiplexing is a technique that allows multiple signals or data streams to share a
                        single
                        communication channel by dividing the available frequency spectrum into distinct frequency
                        bands.

                            synchronized clocks. Data is sent in individual packets or frames, and each packet contains
                            not only the data but also start and stop bits to delineate the data. There is no fixed
                            timing for transmission.</p>

                        <p>Efficiency: Synchronous transmission is more efficient for continuous and real-time data
                            transfer.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Efficiency: Asynchronous transmission is more flexible but can have higher overhead.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>Example: A classic example of synchronous transmission is the traditional voice communication
                            in a telephone call. When you speak into the phone, your voice signals are continuously
                            transmitted and received in real-time. Both the caller and the receiver must maintain
                            synchronized clocks for effective communication.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Example: An example of asynchronous transmission is sending emails. When you compose and send
                            an email, it's broken into discrete packets or frames, each with start and stop bits. These
                            packets are transmitted independently and reassembled at the receiver's end.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Advantages: Synchronous transmission is efficient for real-time applications where data needs
                            to be transferred continuously and predictably. It ensures a constant flow of data.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Advantages: Asynchronous transmission is more flexible and tolerant of variations in timing.
                            It
                            is suitable for scenarios with sporadic or irregular data transmission.</p>

                <div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Disadvantages: It may not be suitable for situations with variable or bursty data traffic, as
                            it requires continuous synchronization.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Disadvantages: It introduces overhead due to the start and stop bits in each packet. It may
                            not
                            be as efficient as synchronous transmission for continuous data transfer.</p>
