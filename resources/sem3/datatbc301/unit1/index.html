                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bus Topology</b>: All devices are connected to a single cable (main bus).</li>

            <h2>Types of Networks:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>LAN (Local Area Network)</b>: Covers a limited geographical area like a home, office, or campus.

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Broadcast & Point-To-Point Networks:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Broadcast Network</b>: In this type of network, data is transmitted from a source to all other
                    connected
                    devices. All devices receive the transmitted data, but only the intended recipient processes it.
                </li>
                <li><b>Point-To-Point Network</b>: Data is transmitted directly from the source to the specific
                    destination
                    device. Other devices on the network do not receive the data.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Modes of Transmission:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Serial Transmission</b>: Data is transmitted bit by bit sequentially over a single communication
                    channel, suitable for long-distance transmission.</li>
                <li><b>Parallel Transmission</b>: Data is transmitted simultaneously over multiple channels, enabling
                    faster
                    data transfer within short distances (e.g., inside a computer).</li>
                <li><b>Synchronous Transmission</b>: Data is transmitted in a continuous stream with synchronized clocks
                    between the sender and receiver to maintain data integrity.</li>
                <li><b>Asynchronous Transmission</b>: Data is transmitted in discrete packets with start and stop bits,
                    and
                    timing is not synchronized between sender and receiver.</li>
                <li><b>Isochronous Transmission</b>: Used in real-time applications, data is transmitted at fixed
                    intervals to
                    ensure a constant and steady data flow, critical for multimedia streaming.</li>

        <h1>Modes of Communication</h1>
        <div class="wh">
            <p><b>Modes of Communication:</b></p>
            <p>Communication modes refer to the direction and flow of data transmission between devices in a network.
                There are three primary modes of communication:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Simplex Mode:</b> In simplex mode, data can only flow in one direction. One device is the sender,
                    and
                    the other device is the receiver. The receiver can only receive data, and the sender can only send
                    data. There is no two-way communication. Examples of simplex mode include radio and television
                    broadcasting, where the information flows from the broadcaster to the viewers, but viewers cannot
                    send any data back.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Half Duplex Mode:</b> In half duplex mode, data can flow in both directions, but not
                    simultaneously.
                    Devices can either send or receive data at any given time, but they cannot do both simultaneously.
                    Think of it as a walkie-talkie communication, where users must press a button to talk (send) and
                    release it to listen (receive).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Full Duplex Mode:</b> In full duplex mode, data can flow in both directions simultaneously.
                    Devices can
                    send and receive data at the same time, allowing for two-way communication. Full duplex
                    communication is commonly used in modern computer networks, where devices can both send and receive
                    data packets simultaneously.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Protocols:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):</b> The foundation of the internet and
                    most modern networks. TCP handles reliable, connection-oriented data transmission, while IP provides
                    the addressing and routing of data packets.</li>
                <li><b>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</b> Used for web communication, allowing the transfer of web
                    pages and resources between a web server and a web browser.</li>
                <li><b>FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</b> Used for transferring files between a client and a server on a
                    network or the internet.</li>
                <li><b>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):</b> Used for sending and receiving email messages between
                    email servers.</li>
                <li><b>DNS (Domain Name System):</b> Converts human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into
                    IP addresses, enabling users to access websites using domain names.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Standards:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers):</b> Known for creating standards
                    related to networking, such as IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) and IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet).</li>
                <li><b>ITU (International Telecommunication Union):</b> Focuses on global telecommunication standards,
                    including those for modems and telecommunications networks.</li>
                <li><b>ISO (International Organization for Standardization):</b> Develops international standards for
                    various industries, including networking.</li>
