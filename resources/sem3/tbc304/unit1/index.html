            <h2>Register Transfer Language (RTL)</h2>
            <p><b>What is register?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Register is a very fast computer memory, used to store data/instruction in-execution.
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Register is a group of flip-flops with each flip-flop capable of storing one bit of
                            information.</li>
                        <li>An <b>n-bit register</b> has a group of n flip-flops and is capable of storing binary
                            information of n-bits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Hence, a register consists of a group of flip-flops and gates.</li>
                <li>Use of flip flop: Flip flop holds the binary information and gates control when when and how new
                    information is transferred into a register.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Some of the commonly used register are:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accumulator</b> : This is the most common register, used to store data taken out from the memory.
                </li>
                <li><b>General Purpose Registers</b> : This is used to store data intermediate results during program
                    execution. It can be accessed via assembly programming.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Special purpose registers:</b> Users do not access these registers. These registers are for computer
                system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>MAR</b> : Memory Address Register are those registers that holds the address for memory unit.
                </li>
                <li><b>MDR</b> : Memory Buffer Register stores instruction and data received from the memory and sent
                    from the memory.</li>
                <li><b>PC</b> : Program Counter points to the next instruction to be executed.</li>
                <li><b>IR</b> : Instruction Register holds the instruction to be executed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Register Transfer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The term register transfer means the availability of hardware logic circuits that can perform a
                    stated micro-operation and transfer the result of the operation to the same or another register.
                </li>
                <li>Register Transfer refers to the movement of data between registers within a computer's central
                    processing unit (CPU) as part of executing instructions. It involves the controlled transfer of
                    binary data from one register to another, often through arithmetic or logic operations, forming
                    the fundamental basis for instruction execution and data manipulation in a computer's
                    microarchitecture.</li>
