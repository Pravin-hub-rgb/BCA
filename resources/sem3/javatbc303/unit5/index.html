            <h2>Introduction to JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>JDBC, which stands for Java Database Connectivity, is a Java-based technology that facilitates
                        communication between Java applications and databases.</li>
                    <li>Contrary to being a programming language, JDBC is a technology that provides a set of Java
                        classes and interfaces for developers to interact with databases, enabling the creation of
                        robust and dynamic applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose of JDBC:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>JDBC serves as a crucial mediator between a Java application and a database, allowing
                                seamless communication and data exchange. This technology is versatile and can be
                                employed in various types of Java applications, including but not limited to applets,
                                servlets, and JSP (JavaServer Pages).
                            <br><img src="../../images/jdbc1.svg" alt="" class="wb"></li>
                            <li>Supported Databases: JDBC is compatible with a wide range of databases such as Oracle,
                                SQL Server, MySQL, and more, making it a universal solution for database connectivity in
                                Java-based projects.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Features of JDBC:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Standard API:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>API (Application Programming Interface):</em> In the context of JDBC, an API refers to a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. JDBC provides a standard API for Java programs to interact with relational databases.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Database Independence:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>JDBC is designed to be a database-independent API. This means that once a JDBC program is developed for a specific database (e.g., Oracle), it can be used with other databases (e.g., SQL) with minimal or no modifications. Typically, only adjustments to the connection details are required.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>JDBC is built on Java, a platform-independent technology. Consequently, JDBC programs can be executed on various operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, macOS, or Unix, without the need for modification. This inherent portability is a result of Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>CRUD and SCUD Operations:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>JDBC facilitates the fundamental database operations: Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD). Additionally, it supports SCUD operations, which involve Select, Create, Update, and Deletion operations, covering a comprehensive range of interactions with a database.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Support for Advanced SQL Concepts:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>JDBC enables developers to work with advanced SQL concepts such as views, triggers, cursors, and stored procedures. This allows for more sophisticated and customized interactions with the underlying database system.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>                    
                    <li><strong>Key Components of JDBC:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Driver:</strong> JDBC drivers play a vital role in the interaction between Java
                                applications and databases. They are platform-specific implementations that enable the
                                translation of Java calls into database-specific calls.</li>
                            <li><strong>Connection:</strong> JDBC facilitates the establishment of a connection to the
                                database using the DriverManager class. This connection is essential for executing SQL
                                queries and transactions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Statement:</strong> JDBC provides various statement interfaces, such as
                                Statement, PreparedStatement, and CallableStatement, to execute SQL queries and updates
                                against the database.</li>
                            <li><strong>ResultSet:</strong> The ResultSet interface allows Java applications to retrieve
                                and process the results of SQL queries from the database.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits of JDBC:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> JDBC's platform independence ensures that Java
                                applications can seamlessly connect to different databases without significant code
                                modifications.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> JDBC supports scalable database access, making it suitable
                                for projects ranging from small-scale applications to large enterprise systems.</li>
                            <li><strong>Security:</strong> JDBC provides mechanisms for secure database transactions,
                                helping developers implement robust security measures in their applications.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
